"many people are pore because they are stupid, make bad decisions, and among other things they don&#39;t have integrity but don&#39;t confuse that word with false pride. most rich people i know work harder than anyone els but also smarter, many work 16+ hours a day. this Asian concept of rich is misleading and if you believe this premise you will be the same. i have seen many rich and ultra rich people loose it all through war or other cataclysmic event. it dos not take long the go right back to the top starting from the absolute bottom with nothing. those are the people you need to observe if you want to succeed. they are friendly appreciate hard work and WILL help anyone who puts in the effort they don&#39;t see colour, how much you have or who&#39;s family you belong too. the rich people in this movie are not the norm. and they are not what they seem either. plus there wealth may just be transitory only to disappear in the obscurity with one bad gamble, stupid family member or economic change.  these are communistic ideas of what successful people are designed to keep you poor. they are bait, the gatekeepers of sorts that hold people back.",Vince,2023-05-22T11:57:10Z,0

"I believe her point is to explain where religious prohibitions come from an attempt to manage vectors of impurity. The reason that one can see that this is not purely practical is that social constructs determine what forms impurity.

I hate it when people use capitalism as the argument against everything bad, as we haven’t really shown any better way.  The truth is that our current way of capitalism is greed gone mad and we need ethical capitalism where the CEO  doesn’t make 2000 times more then the lowest earner.   The movie shows you what’s wrong with our current form of capitalism but until we find a better way, the only solution is to fix the greed within this system.",Haku Kuze,2023-05-09T05:28:47Z,0

"In a fair and level transaction, neither are parasites, both receive something positive in the end. When a part of the transaction has to be withdrawn to support inefficient state policies and projects, the real parasite of today&#39;s society appears, the enormous state burden. If we try to regulate and tax more to try to balance the equation, we are actually creating more and more jobs for bureaucrats while the problems are made even worse.

"As someone from Asia. Subjugation of someone preciving as lessers are far too common.  The lower class did not revolt, rather it had accepted the rule. They themselves are not innocent of their own suffering, they are actually the perpetrator of inequality. Such is the social structure of south-east Asia. They are bidding on their kids to be successful so that they themselves will be the oppressor. Most asians nowadays won&#39;t have kids because they can&#39;t care for them proper and there is no hope for them to increase their relative social status against another.

He&#39;s waiting for you to accept Him and come to Him with open arms in a genuine personal relationship and there&#39;s no other love ever like His since He loves you eternally and infinitely so believe in the LORD GOD KING JESUS CHRIST YESHUA HAMASHIACH, receive His HOLY SPIRIT that will dwell in you, change you, lead you, guide you, and be your absolute best friend as GOD the HOLY SPIRIT just alongside CHRIST JESUS the Son Of GOD, GOD incarnate, also finally GOD the FATHER, which those 3 together make the HOLY TRINITY; GOD THE FATHER YHWH JEHOVAH, GOD THE SON CHRIST JESUS YESHUA HAMASHIACH, AND GOD THE HOLY SPIRIT, the one and only true GOD. I love you but nowhere near as much as GOD. Repent by believing in the LORD GOD KING JESUS CHRIST and thou shalt be saved, and once you tell JESUS that you believe in Him and genuinely trust in Him by inviting Him into your heart, you are sealed unto the Day of Redemption and you cannot lose your salvation in CHRIST JESUS and He will help you live for Him with His HOLY SPIRIT Amen, the Rapture is the Day of Redemption also which is so extremely very soon and He does not want you or anybody to be left behind nor me nor you do.

"parasite is a very well written movie It talks about power, greed and hope,it says that how humans are capitalist by nature, That a person only thinks about himself that when a poor family has power, they will not help other poor but will only think about themselves, There is a power hierarchy in the society and the one who has more power, he considers the one with less power as a filth. This film talk about privilege also that a higher class person gets everything but a lower class person has to work 10 times more to get that, Everything in this film was well balanced there is no villain in this film the real villain is the situation<br>Yes bong didn&#39;t give any reason for &quot;all or nothing&quot; but that&#39;s the whole point that&#39;s why it feels surprising,The murder of Mar Park by Mar kim was a very psychological act,The murder of Mar Park by Mar Kim is very surprising and to understand it, you need to understand the psychology of Mar Kim.<br>Kim never wanted to kill Park, it was the situation that led to this act,Jealousy and anger have already boiled over in Kim&#39;s mind against Park,And it&#39;s shown in a very subtle way,He used to respect the park a lot, but later he came to know that he just thinks of him as a worker who stinks alot This thing was deeply disturbing to Kim inside,A big truth was already revealed in front of Kim(secret bunker),And right after that he heard Mr. Park say about himself that he stinks, and later her whole house got washed away by the rain all trouble came upon him in one night Still, he has to go to work in the morning, where the Park family is about to enjoy a birthday party But still the park treats him like a worker wo stinks they are completely unaware of his problem,Even when geun se killed Kim&#39;s daughter, Park was only thinking about his son and he should logically think about his son first But Kim felt bad for this work of Park because of his hatred, when Park shrunk his nose to avoid the smell, then Kim felt worse,in that situation, his suppressed hatred and jealousy came out in the form of anger, which led to the murder of the <a href=""http://park.kim/"">park.Kim</a> had no Big reason to kill Park and he never want to kill mr Park it just happened to him like a DREAM a BAD DREAM And he got punished for this because he did wrong he had to leave his family and stay in the bunker and later he also apologized to the park, but now nothing is going to happen with this apology, crime was already committed now he will have to atone for it ,this shows the jealousy and hatred of the lower class against the higher class, And the movie never justifies Kim&#39;s crime,Kim was not a psycho killer, he was a normal person, he committed this crime, which he regrets, but now nothing is going to happen by regretting,In the last, a conversation between a father and son is shown which is very emotional, a son will never consider his father a criminal He also knows that my father is not such a person, but nothing can happen now,In the end, the film ends on Hope, despite all this, ki woo never stops hoping,I don&#39;t know whether he will be able to get that house or not, but God bless him to buy such a house so that when it rains next time, he can enjoy it with his family like mr park does.<br>Both families were not parasite in this film the real parasite was human greed,hatred, jealousy and situation",G Chudasama Darshit,2023-03-27T02:51:39Z,2
"The use of lines and stairs in this movie is used heavily. Certain characters stand away, below, or above others and you know who&#39;s in power during those conversations. When the family escape the house to run back and find their apartment flooded, they go down endless staircases. They go deep below the ground while the Parks are high above the downpour. It&#39;s a show not tell moment in the film that speaks volumes. Also worth noting is at the exact middle of the movie is when the genre changes.",Ebbie,2023-03-26T00:50:35Z,0

What i got was that the dad in the &quot;poor family&quot; couldn&#39;t tolerate the polite, but obvious, despise that the rich guy - not even his wife, that as a i said was barely a little tone deaf - had towards him. The constant hints about not passing &quot;the limit&quot;, the smell, the request to partecipate in the son&#39;s birthday only to &quot;remind&quot; him that it was work, etc. That, imho, is also the only way it justify such a final violent reaction.

Anti Capitalist when you&#39;re poor but Capitalist when you&#39;re rich.

The parks were elitist snobs that didn&#39;t give a shit about the people around them except for what service they could provide for the parks. But the Kim&#39;s were also lying, manipulative rats that also didn&#39;t give a shit about the people around them except for the money they could get from them. <br><br>And one last thing about the kims,  they didn&#39;t even consider for a second to help the other family that had it worse than them.

So one need to work at day and another need to work at night. <br>How is it possible that one person only earn $300 per month while other can earn more than $10k a week? It’s almost impossible to catch and this is why most of this people really believe that the only way is for God to help them. <br>As For people that live in a country like Australia, Korea, Japan, US, and Europe, we got a better chance to escape from the poor cycle to become the middle class and maybe some can go to upper class because of the education, etc however some of the middle class took it for granted like spending money for lifestyle and still complaining about how is the rich got away so easily.

"Something I find spooky about the ideas this film presents is how there isn’t really an actionable solution at the moment.

What can an individual control? I’d like to hit a six figure income and find good organizations to donate to while living a good life and following my own ambitions, but who do you give to? What if one organization is a front for another corporate and/or political giant? What if you give your money to someone that pisses it away? Is there a way to get it to individuals who deserve it? Does everyone deserve it? How is that quantified? Who deserves to pick who deserves it?<br><br>Furthermore, what can we change in our society without activating a different yet equally flawed and disfigured ideology? Regardless of which you pick, how can you keep them safe from the greedy and corrupt that have historically ruined all of them? Is it a fundamental problem of ideology?

"Reaganomics or Siphon Economics, which I like to call it, is NOT real Capitalism! To use an analogy, if Siphon Economics was a car. Then people arguing for it would say things like: If we just take more fuel out of the car. The car will go further and faster. Which any simpleton would understand was a false statement, but switch it to something they dont understand, aka macro economics, and they will be fooled.<br><br>This movie isnt anti capitalism. It is anti siphon economics. It is anti badly regulated capitalism.<br> Capitalism is not about &quot;greed&quot; or &quot;poverty&quot;, but it is about efficiency via fiat currency (money). How do you create a product with the least amount of input (raw materials, labor, power, transport etc). The measurement in this context for success is the bottom line because everything mentioned uses fiat currency to to pay for. The more money you make, the more efficient you are. However the negatives is that the more suksessfull you are, the more your out compete others. This creates less competition and in turn can also lead to lower quality products again, but it also creates wealth and leverage concentrations which in turn can damage the middle class and shrink it.<br><br>What keeps capitalism alive? Money? LoL, no. It is DEMAND. Who creates the most demand in a society? The middle class. You remove the middle class or shrink it. You will, adjusted for inflation, reduce the size of your nations economy over time unless it is just a low bar raw material export nation. In short, pushing policies that damages the middle class is bad for capitalism. Not taxes the most successful allot is bad for capitalism. Not splitting up &quot;to big to fail&quot; type companies (anti trust laws) is bad for capitalism. Too little or unenforced regulation is bad for capitalism.<br><br>Reaganomics, aka Siphon economics, are against any type of policies that would change capitalism to a better version that is also sustainable in the future. Reaganomics focus more on individual companies bottom line, they should get everything they want, at the cost of the nation, its citizens and global demand level. Which long term will LOWER economic activity, because in reality it is just siphoning wealth from the treasury (lower taxes, no corporate responsibility, offsetting costs of labor, environment and so on onto the government) and citizens (anti union or any other form of leverage, against worker rights and so on) in the name of short term profits.

"Yahshua - you know Him as Jesus - was born to a virgin, turned water to wine, taught, healed the sick, raised the dead, casted out demons, walked on water, calmed the storm, and fed a crowd of thousands with a few fish and a few loaves of bread, among many other things. He was killed on the cross as payment for the sins of all mankind, three days later He rose from the dead. Forty days later He ascended into heaven where He sits at the right hand of the Father. He is returning very soon, but before He does, Satan, the devil, is coming to pretend to be Jesus/God (2 Thessalonians 2:1-4). Satan is an angel, and he will have certain supernatural powers with which to try to fool everyone. He will, for example, be able to make fire come down from heaven in the sight of men. He will only be on earth a short time before the real King of Kings, Jesus Christ, God in the flesh, returns. When the real Jesus comes we will all be transformed into our spiritual bodies at the same moment. Jesus came in the flesh to offer forgiveness of sins and eternal life to anyone who believes and calls on His precious name!<br><br>if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. - Romans 10:9<br><br>Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat. But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste? For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor. When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me. For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always. For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial. Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her. - Matthew 26:6-13<br><br>Seek ye the LORD while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near: Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon....<br><br>To anoint your self, the sick, or a building for spiritual protection:<br>Get a small bottle of olive oil and pour off a small amount into a smaller vessel like a vial or baby food jar. Use the rest of the bottle for cooking. Ask the Lord to bless your vial of oil in Jesus name. Anoint yourself with the oil by placing a dab of oil on tip of finger and touch it to your forehead, and ask the Lord to bless you/heal you. Place a dab of oil on your finger and anoint the door posts and order all negativity and evil out of the house, and order that nothing negative or evil can enter into your home including piggybacking on a person entering, order it  to be so in the name of Jesus. Anoint all potential entrances to your home. To anoint the sick, place oil on tip of finger and touch it to the head of the sick and say a prayer of healing over them in Jesus name.

Surround yourself with these people and you will never struggle in life, but always provide them value so you have meaning and purpose to their lives, otherwise they will throw you out, and replace you in the blink of an eye.",MadRain,2022-10-22T07:13:06Z,0

"I enjoyed this video, but you&#39;re wrong about the desire for pale skin being linked to Eurocentrism. I don&#39;t understand why so many westerners think this, when Asians will tell you that it has to do with the working class vs the wealthy. That&#39;s always been the reason, it didn&#39;t require influence from other countries. The wealthy got to stay inside and out of the harsh sun, while the working class were exposed to the harsh sun while in the fields... and this is still the case today in many counties. <br><br>In the west you can find the opposite: people will get a tan (real, spray, bronzing lotion, etc) to make themselves look like they&#39;re well off and taking vacations to sunny beaches. <br><br>To be clear, I don&#39;t care how someone wants to present themselves.

"yeah like in my opinion, for instance, when we consume meat, we alienate the suffering of the victime, setting the sacrifice in a place out of consumer&#39;s experience. To validate meat consumption, each person should take part in the victim&#39;s sacrifice, at least once in a while, so you can experience on first hand what it actually takes (the experience of suffering and death) to serve your dish on your table . Either way, upper classes should take direct part in the victim&#39;s sacrifice (the worker&#39;s explotation), in order to validate their consumption of the meat (surplus value).",Abay Perez,2022-08-28T21:12:48Z,0

I don’t think it is as cut and dry as you make it sound. The disparity of wealth has its roots in many more things than class alone and far more bleak. Take fluid intelligence and trait consciousness. The disparity of these things in between people accounts for huge differences in life out comes. They are the two highest measurable correlation’s with life out come. Both political sides cannot address these issues try as they might. I liked your video tho and enjoyed the movie greatly.

"It seems like the poor family should be able to afford some place nicer given that they are all employed by the rich family. Even if they all have low wage jobs, like working at fast food, it should be enough for a reasonable apartment if they pool their money. If they can con their way to work for the rich family, I don&#39;t see how they would have problem finding low wage jobs. I don&#39;t see any big issue, like health problems, addictions, high debt, mental problems, etc. It&#39;s an interesting story, but it&#39;s distorted from reality, or at least an exaggeration. I mean, this is S. Korea, a relatively rich country with inequality (at least from using Gini coefficient) that is less of an issue than US and UK.<br><br>Also, &quot;leeching&quot; or being a &quot;parasite&quot; seems like a very negative way of thinking about it. The rich family and the poor family are in a somewhat mutually beneficial situation (minus the ending where the rich dad and poor daughter were murdered). That&#39;s the point of capitalism, you pay for service and the business gets a small profit, win-win situations. The possible &quot;leeching&quot; parts, perhaps, are the rich wife doesn&#39;t do anything even though she&#39;s not employed, or the two unqualified tutors that are not really helping the rich kids. Even then, it&#39;s not a critique to the rich or the poor in general but these two families specifically.

"You can say the family exploit the park&#39;s generosity and good nature. But I don&#39;t think the park is leeching off their labour. Because they are paid, and most importantly they pay well. The job they did folding those boxes while being fumigated is a much more terrible work condition and safe to assume it pays a lot less. Not to mention when they had that garden party the chauffer was asked to help and he was paid overtime. I think it was very generous of them to do that. Most employee get you to do these stuff as a kind of friendly favour.<br>Also the funny thing is at the beginning, while the family has been very unethical in getting their jobs, they earned the money through honest work, they just<br> Didnt get the job through honest means, well except for the sister, the brother whole didnt have a degree  apparently is more than capable of teaching english than people with higher and better qualifications than him.<br>In any case even though they deceived the park, they do what they are paid to.

"Love this, I also wanted to point out that the whitening skin phenomenon can also be traced to class/stratum and not just eurocentric ideas of beauty (although eurocentric ideas of beauty now play a role). In many places in Southeast Asia at least, where I live, it&#39;s a legacy from medieval times where if you were pale or &quot;white&quot; you were most likely of the upper class such as the nobility or royalty. If you were darker-skinned, you were most likely of the lower class since you worked outside under the sun such as farmers, fishermen, etc. Because of this, the beauty standard became such that people aspired to appear like the upper class. <br><br>Also at least in Indonesia, the word &quot;white&quot; in the many different languages here refer to &quot;pale&quot; in terms of skin color. But when you literally translate the word to English, it&#39;s &quot;white&quot;. This word refers to the color as how people understood it during pre-colonial times. When the white-skinned (i.e. European) colonizers came, the meaning of those words shifted, but because the literal word preceded a colonial understanding of skin color, the word remained.",raj,2022-01-19T05:59:48Z,1

If enough people are not satisfied with the wages and the Parks want a certain quality of service, they will raise wages. This video is a kindergarten level understanding of capitalism no doubt indoctrinated by a university in which professors applaud a system where wealth is distributed involuntarily.

"The criticisms in Parasite are much almost identical to those the Korean satire “Yangban chŏn” (“Tale of a Yangban”) written during the later Chosun Dynasty. Parasite doesn&#39;t represent capitalism. The story in Parasite represents Korea&#39;&#39;s Neo-Confucianism and traditional Korean social structure. These systems and their criticism predate both the Enlightenment and Capitalism and one could easily write Parasite as a portrayal of north Korean society and economy, given their reversion to Neo-Confucianism under the banner of KimIlSungism and their centralized economic control. That being the case, I think it is a reach to apply an interpretation of Parasite to Neo-Capitalism.<br>Those failing morals in Parasite that push the story through to the end are ignorance and greed.",Charles Tustison,2021-09-29T19:20:25Z,2

I think if they care enough abt those who work at their house they might actually figure that something is wrong. The husband didn&#39;t care enough to actually find out why his driver is suddenly used his car to have sex when he has never done that before. The wife didn&#39;t care enough about the maid that suddenly got sick. It&#39;s actually pretty easy to figure out when the son said that their clothes smell the same but they just didn&#39;t care because of the wall that the parks build to separate them.,Silver Lightning,2021-09-21T05:35:08Z,0

I’m not sure what Bong-Joon-ho’s allegorical intentions were with the film but regardless, his movie does not succeed at painting the Parks (or capitalism) as any sort of villain, or presenting the poor families as victims. In fact it does the opposite.<br><br>Objectively, the Parks never actually do anything wrong. 1) They never actually know the poor family is poor (because they are impersonating middle/upper class workers), even up till the end of the movie when it is explicitly said that Yeon-kyo, the wife, didn’t understand why her driver killed her husband. This is relevant because it means their remarks about foul smells and boundaries, is not manifestation of class-based prejudice or superiority complex, but a professional expectation. Keep this fact in mind for my next points. 2) The parasite metaphor is inappropriate to describe the Parks. They apparently pay the family very well for their work as Min explicitly states to Ki-woo near the start…I can’t actually think of a single wrong thing the Parks do that cannot be truly explained as mischaracterizations potentially borne from the prejudice and resentment.<br><br>The poor family on the other hand have no shortage of guilt. 1) Ki-woo’s initial crime of forgery/fraud could be excused since it was masterminded by his friend, but he then assists his entire family to conspire and commit multiple acts of slander and fraud and even man slaughter. 2) The stone given to Ki-Woo by Min at the start is expensive as the director himself has stated. Rather than sell this stone or otherwise monetize it for income, Ki-Woo sees fit to use it as a murder weapon. 3) Kim Ki-take has no reason to be resentful of Yeon-kyo for her remarks about the rain being a blessing, she had no idea, nor could she ever have imagined that he and his family were suffering as a direct result. Besides, if the poor family had been at home eating their own food, bought with the money they now certainly had, rather than stealing food and alcohol from the Parks, they would apparently have saved their home from flooding. 4) The flooding of their home was also their fault, the had left the window open before and had had multiple warnings in the form of the drunk man to close their window. 5) Kim Ki-taek cannot hold against the Parks what they say in the privacy of their own home, without the knowledge they were being surveilled by (essentially) home invaders. 6) my final point is that Kim Ki-take shows no proactivity in ensuring that he as a husband and father provides for his family, the pizza box job is found by his wife, the Park jobs are sought out by his son and all the while he plays a passive role in seeking financial opportunities for his family, yet he has the audacity to fee emasculated/oppressed by another man’s comfort…<br><br>In light of these narrative details and more, it’s absurd that one would try to paint the main poor family as victims. While their circumstances are very sympathetic and unfortunate in many moments, they are also demonstrably covetous, reckless and criminally opportunistic. The movie taken on it’s own, does not by any stretch paint a morally ambiguous picture. (I purposely left the poor ex-maid couple out of my critique because their arc is a bit tangential to the main character’s)",Okitan,2021-09-08T03:00:58Z,1

"Less to do with class and more to do with the worst of the human condition. Never once felt an ounce of empathy for the Parks. At every opportunity they lied, cheated, steal, manipulated, framed others to only meet their base wants NOT needs. Look at something as simple as the Parks work ethic. They couldnt even fold pizza boxes right. Its BS lie that no one has a chance at upward mobility. Inequality is part of life and and every facet of the animal kingdom. The struggle of the human condition is to over come whatever obstacles come at you because what is the alternative. The Parks are worthy of contempt because every move is done out of selfishness. Even the son went downstairs to try to kill the people downstairs in the basement to continue the charade but he dropped the rock. Tired of the class warfare BS comparisons. This has way more to do the ugliness of human envy, of covetousness and pride. Its a classic example why people are inherently bad, not good.",Red McC,2021-09-05T01:48:49Z,1

"The movie shows that in capitalism, it&#39;s a struggle between maintaining the status quo (being rich) and climbing up the ladder in the case of the Kim&#39;s. It is possible that Kim&#39;s are so left behind because the generation behind them was either too lazy to work their way up in order to provide the current Kim&#39;s the opportunity to climb up the social ladder, while the Park&#39;s parents most likely have worked their asses off to be able to afford their children the education they need in order to get themselves the opportunity to earn money enough to live comfortably for the rest of their lives. I guess it just depends on how you look at your situation if you are poor. You can dwell on it and keep being pity to yourself or do something about it so that your sons and daughters will at least have the opportunity to live with work that can feed themselves for the rest of their lives without begging from others.

"Ah yes, watching capitalism sucks videos on Youtube, by far the greatest compendium of information ever compiled. Made possible only by capitalism, the system that pays people according to their contribution. Instead of asking that people contribute according to their ability, like marxism.<br><br>You can whine all you want about our version of capitalism and it&#39;s many flaws, but I went from a hopeless college dropout to starting and owning a small business under this system.<br><br>And as for this insane divisive promotion of classism - it&#39;s bullshit. I have lots of customers ranging from so poor that they have to call friends to get enough money for me to make their car drivable again, to people with collections of antique cars. And I can tell you that there is no correlation at all between social status and moral worth. Poor people are not more noble than the rich. Of course inequality is vast, and it would be nice if there weren&#39;t so much of it. But recognizing that is not the same as pushing the violent narrative that the rich are the cause of all the world&#39;s problems.

"I enjoyed this video, but I feel like you’re forgetting a major component about your situation that should have been discussed. <br><br>To speak badly about the state of society is a privilege. Most people are just surviving. The average family of 5 has dad making $1000 a month worldwide. For most people, capitalism is not a question, it’s existence. Everyone at the bottom is hungry to get at the top. But when most westerns, living a comfortable life, think about that, they think pity those poor people. But what westerners really should be thinking about is fear. All westerners need to confront their fear about poorness.<br><br>Because you see, we are all complicit in making capitalism work. Almost every human alive. The average worldwide family makes 1k a year. Do you want to make $10,000 a year? You cannot say you disagree with capitalism if you don’t say yes to this. Some people might not know how far 10k gets you. Check Brazil out. The truth is, the moment you have more, the moment you will never want to give it up. So your answer is almost certainly yes. That makes you complicit. Welcome to the 99%.<br><br>Then we can agree that capitalism is a natural state of being. There is no world where western living becomes the norm in the next 100 years. It’s only if everyone is comfortable with giving up material wealth like Jesus that we can come to some semblance of communism. But that will never happen as long as people want more over others.<br><br>The truth is is that the best we can do is push for more socialist policies as capitalism grows. It’s easy to try to DISMANTLE capitalism, but it’s hard to actually BUILD a different kind of society, which is what I wish a lot of more people wisened up on. It’s so normalized to get angry over systems without understanding the system in a 360 lens, not just what you hate about it. Hate leads nowhere.<br><br>Lastly, the reason why I brought this up is because I feel like talking badly about capitalism without disclaiming you come from the upper end of capitalism makes you disingenuous.

Interesting film. But this doesn’t change the fact that it does not matter where you came from. You can live your dream life. Cause and effect are real. Follow the principles necessary to achieve your goals and you will be successful. One does not become wealthy. One first becomes a certain type of person and then wealth is a product of that change. Not the other way around. There’s a reason the wealthy separate them selves. Because they observed this fact and acted on it while others either did not see it or did not act. Either way this creates a major disconnect because the poor won’t ever be able to understand why you do what you do unless they themselves switch their mindset. These films always show rich wealthy people just living life. Never show the story of how they got the money. Because believe it or not majority of millionaires are self made. Meaning they did not receive an inheritance. And the story of how they got it will show you everything you need to know about why they separate themself from the poor.,Matthew773,2021-08-20T18:15:54Z,0

"Wow, unbelievable! is that what you gleaned from the movie? capitalism is bad?? Let me tell you something, this pattern of few rich and many poor has occurred many many times in history (under different regimes) and it will continue to happen (even under socialism, please don&#39;t be so naive to map pattern only to the current regime). Any new system you invent will still have motivated individuals with high productivity vs lower productivity, the highly motivated highly productive individuals will find new ways to rise to the top. The thing is, this is just as natural as anything else in the universe, it follows power-laws. <br><br>My father was a poor worker just like the ones you speak about, he however, worked hard and put me through school and saved up money for my higher education because he didn&#39;t want me to be like him, he succeeded, he is the best dad in the world for me, I&#39;ll always be grateful to him and his sacrifices. The point I&#39;m trying to make is, in America, familial connections or sacrifice for family member is unheard of, their value system is so hollow that they have to find something external to blame for their predicament. <br><br>All of these rich-poor arrangements are exactly the same, they peak and break down and a new one will take its place.

I, too, worked hard, saved and am now a £ multi-millionaire even though I&#39;ve only been an engineer throughout my career. So....<br>1) the system does promote privilege and wealth through inheritance and old-boys networks but 2) if we work hard, don&#39;t squander what we earn, invest for our senior years we can end up with good wealth (I certainly don&#39;t need more at 60) but 3) if I&#39;d be born into a properly poor family - rather than one of modest means - I might really have struggled to have the support and learn from my family the ambition to do well.<br>At the end of the day, capitalism created your iphone and the yt channel and the low-cost airline you go on holiday with - they would never have happened without it.

"The reason why those that benefit off of capitalism see those who don’t differently is because they’ve come to the realization that it’s possible for anyone to benefit off the situation. It takes a weak and egotistical mind to not be successful in a capitalist country which is why ultimately what happened in the movie happened. Poor people tend to be emotionally charged thus blinding them from reality. This is why poor people are easy to control. It’s easy to play w their emotions and direct them. This is why the rich get rich and the poor get poor. Because one class knows how to reason without emotion and knows what needs to be done, not what they want to be done.",Alex B,2021-08-20T10:16:13Z,0

"I wouldn&#39;t even classify any modern economy, capitalistic anymore. It&#39;s Crony capitalism or the Aristocratic style of capitalism. This type of structure, grew out of the Great Depression, which brought the government more into our day-to-day lives.  A crisis is either created artificially or naturally occurring. The solution is to print money, create more programs, tax more people, regulate more industries and bail out poorly run businesses. Knowing this, to gain control of the people and instigate a structure that does not allow any person or group of people(corporation) to enter any field of the economy. All you need to do is control the government. Which is done through lobbying and typical corruption measures. Making the government a representative of the big corporation and not the citizens of the nation. Causing the weak to suffer and the rich to grow stronger.",Faris Bakkar,2021-08-20T01:02:40Z,0

"I feel like the people in the comments section are kind of misguided. Everyone’s being all pessimistic. Of course many of us in the comments section will never be apart of the 1 percent. Hell most of us won’t even be in the top 15 percent of wealth? But when was any of that ever a requirement to live a happy and fulfilling life? How many ludicrously wealthy and successful people have been found suicidal or found overdosed on drugs? Life is a game. But the main objective is not to have the biggest house, or the most accolades or the nicest car. Many people have reached those “achievements” and they still don’t feel like they’ve won the game. The main objective is to find honest, pure and genuine contentment. You find that and you can walk around like a bad-ass confident bitch anywhere you go. <br><br>What I liked about parasite (and this awesome video essay) was how versatile it is. As a middle class American, I always found it mind riveting how there were scenes where I related to the Kims, but conversely there were also parts where the bougie-ass family was more relatable. Nothing in this life is black and white. And it shouldn’t be seen in such a dire light 24/7. <br><br>We always pity those really destitute people on the margins. People in war torn countries living in UN assisted camps, people forced to work in sweatshops, homeless people who have no where to sit because park benches are spiky, children and mothers in developing nations who walk a mile for the nearest clean water. We, the privileged people on the Internet, who are sitting safely within a sheltered home with secure enough connection to even see this video, should also be ashamed of reflecting onto the people who are truly on the margins of society. <br><br>It’s such a typical first world thing to say “oh poor homeless man” Or “oh poor person in developing country, let me hastily donate eighty dollars to appease my conscience”...but if we were to actually come into contact with those on the real fringes of society and speak to them, they’d tell you they’re either content with their situation or that it’s not as bad as it seems. And they’re probably being honest. Think about it. If being “poor” (because wealth as a concept is relative) is all one ever knows they’re not gonna mind. Speaking from personal experience, my first few years of life were characterized by me living in a two bedroom apartment only a couple miles away from the US-Mexican border in southern Cali. The fire hydrant as a water park, clothes from Walmart, spaghetti almost every dinner, the Disney channel being a privilege at our more well-off relative’s house and eating at McDonald’s as special occasions were all I knew. But damn I was content because it was all I knew. And then my dad actually did get a promotion at work, my family relocated to the east and we lived a relatively stable life. Hell, I even went through tuition based Catholic schooling from the time I was in 1st grade all the way up til senior year. How’s that for upward mobility not being possible? <br><br>I just, I admire this video essay, but the defeatist and pessimistic attitude people have in the comments section is very frustrating. Life is not as rigid as we would like to believe it to be. It’s just not enough people (especially those in the middle) have enough gusto to work for it. Also, Im not a boomer, I’m Gen Z and I can see why older generations call us a whiny generation. Yes, the economy these days is way more complicated than what it was say 50 years ago....the job market is over saturated but it’s not a starkly unfair, or unyielding situation..we literally have the whole ass internet to serve as a walking living breathing business card for employers. <br><br>Sure, that main dude in parasite will probably never have enough in his lifetime to afford the Park house? But why look at the situation that way? I think the movie ends on an optimistic note regardless. Because even if he’ll never buy the house, by the end of the movie he’s in a much better position then he was at the beginning. He has a goal...to work and improve his situation. It won’t be a lavish, beautiful house but what I love about the ending is that you can interpret as you want. <br><br>Even during the scene where he’s talking to his dad in the gymnasium. Its been a year since I last saw it but there’s a scene where he tells his dad how he wants to do better. He wants to work hard (and i think he even mentions going back to school?) Both of the families were bad in their own way. Just because they were on the fringes of society, that didn’t excuse their continual exploitation of the wealthy family. And of course nothing excused the rich family’s treatment towards the poor family. <br>We shouldn’t under scrutinize people because they’re poor, we shouldn’t over scrutinize people because they’re rich. Classism is classism no matter how it manifests. <br><br>It’s reality. A poor person can improve their situation. can a homeless man on the street become the next Jeff bezos in the same lifetime? No. But whose to say he even wants to be as wealthy as Jeff bezos. To him just living in an apartment with running water is lavish enough for him. Yes, most of us in this comment section will never be in the 1 percent. But by prioritizing that goal, aren’t we just perpetuating the same game capitalism aims to set? <br><br>Here’s my interpretation of the ending...the protagonist goes back to school, gets a job, saves enough to bail out his dad, gets a decent house that can <b>comfortably</b> hold both his parents and himself. They don’t have to deal with fumigators treating them like pesticides anymore. Bingo bongo and that’s on the capitalist dream. Upward economic mobility is still a very real possibility. Its just not as needed for most people who can sit comfortably behind a computer screen all day. <br><br>In fact, I’d even wager that the reason we see Ki-woo buying the house at the end was to help us the audience relate to Ki-woo’s ambitions more. For us, the class of people who don’t need to work all day, we have the privilege of getting to watch film and critique it. And i bet the director or whoever put the scene in knew a majority of the audience would be middle class. If im correct, I don’t even think Ki-woo states that he wants to buy the house, his main ambition is to simply make enough to save his dad and improve his situation. But they paired it with the visual imagery of him getting the bougie house because it’d connect more with the mainstream audience, us,,,the middle class. Because a majority of the viewers would be elated to get sweet digs like that. We’d be as elated as Ki-woo would be to both simply just leave the flooded parasite den and rescue his father. Emphasis on simply leaving. He doesn’t want to be the next Park family. My interpretation is he simply wants to improve rather than be a parasite the rest of his life. Because upward mobility, no matter how small or grand, is still and always is possible. :)",In Hobi’s wine cellar,2021-08-17T02:36:13Z,2

"Parasite, which arrived between Green Book and Nomadland, won the Oscar for best picture and the Oscar for best foreign film, which might be a once in a lifetime occurrence. It is a sign of social recognition (at least from an American viewpoint), if not social change. Although a South Korean film, Parasite has a setting and a situation that seem more American than America itself. That is, until you know America better. It could be an indictment of &quot;The American Way&quot;. By sheer coincidence, Green Book and Parasite and Nomadland form a thematic trilogy, as they represent the past, the present, and the future of the United States, of life in the dark underbelly of a &quot;first world&quot; country that is a &quot;leader&quot; of &quot;the free world&quot;.

"The movie isn&#39;t necessarily a criticism of capitalism itself, it&#39;s more of a critic of those who are in power take advantage of the common folk and use them to keep themselves at the top, while presenting themselves as people to be grateful of otherwise we&#39;d be so much worse.

"The truth is this: We humans are imperfect creatures, if you ever delude yourself into thinking that some people are evil while you&#39;re the good one just pause. For 100,000 years we were nomads fighting nature and animals, hunting and gathering food with no assurance of survival, life was a misery for most of the time, then we lived 6,000 years as farmers working in the fields for a King, Pharaoh, Nobleman etc, 95% of everyone were dirt poor making the Kims look like royalties. The cruel irony of the last hundred years is that capitalism lifted millions out of these dirt poor conditions others today still live in, and it did all of this while still being an inhuman cruel system. No country has ever prospered without capitalism. No society has ever succeeded that didn&#39;t have classes. We know capitalism is a destructive force but so is socialism, whether you&#39;re Gramsci, Marx or Horkhimer, or if you&#39;re Smith, Marshall or Friedman your vision of the world always fails. No Smith, capitalism won&#39;t solve suffering... No Gramsci communist revolution won&#39;t solve suffering either cause all of these solutions have a common denominator, humans, and there&#39;s the issue. We haven&#39;t changed in our biological source code for tens of thousands of years, in our brains we&#39;re still nomads fighting for food, that&#39;s why obesity exists, it&#39;s a perfect example of how our civilisations outrun our own nature as humans. I guess I&#39;ve outed myself as a pessimist, but I have faith in that technology can solve problems for real.

"as a korean film it also thumbs its nose at the japanese!<br><br>they selected an actor for the servant dad who looks very japanese, and they have him liking german cars!<br><br>also where the other guy bangs his head on the light switches saying &quot;respect&quot;,<br>I think the film is thumbing its nose at the japanese custom of bowing to everyone all the time.<br><br>by likening that bowing to banging your forehead on light switches for your boss to drably ascend the stairs.<br><br>some parts of the film are korean specific cultural references, whereas others are general references.<br><br>that headbanging guy I think was chinese (it is some years since I watched the film, I think possibly they were taiwanese), and here also the koreans are bitching about the chinese,<br>and in one part the predecessor servant woman feigns being a north korean tv presenter,<br>this is a cultural reference to north korea.<br><br>and these bitchings are essentially divide and conquer, get each nation fearing and despising all other nations.<br><br>the rich dad says about his son getting interested in indian culture, and this in fact is red indian, where the son has a teepee,  rather than the country of India. This also is misdirection, where they are brainwashing the koreans to associate the word &quot;indian&quot; with red indian, rather than India. This is divide and conquer to prevent koreans associating with India, historically Korea was part of Indochina, where it was a dominion of India. The koreans are partly indian, and their language also has indian words within it eg if you watch the video &quot;mr simple&quot; by &quot;super junior&quot;, <br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKJykl7ez9A"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKJykl7ez9A</a><br>you will hear the word dekho used many times, which in the indian languages means &quot;look!&quot;, and relates to the english words decor and decorate.<br><br>the thais and cambodians also are partly indian.

"@Gao Ai Bai  <br>I replayed some of your link at 50% speed where I can compare the lyrics with the transliteration, at full speed it is too fast for someone who doesnt know korean. The truth is I dont know much about korea, but I have noticed similarities with indian things when watching korean films, which I dont see with say japanese things.<br><br>what I am referring to is before the islamic conquest of India, and that islamic conquest of India in fact originates from Genghis Khan, eg shah Jahan who created the Taj Mahal claimed to be descended from Genghis. He ruled from 1628 to 1658 and was the 5th emperor from the Mogul dynasty. I think &quot;mogul&quot; is probably an indian transliteration of mongol, sometimes also transliterated as mughal.<br><br>I am talking of conquests from much further back in time, eg there was hinduism in Cambodia, eg the Angkor Wat temple complex was &quot;hindu&quot;, which was built 1113 to  1150AD.<br><br><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angkor_Wat"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angkor_Wat</a><br><br>it began as hindu and eventually was converted to buddhist.<br><br>The word &quot;hindu&quot; is itself an externally applied idea, in fact it is a spiritual culture and not a centrally controlled religion, which includes diverse beliefs and traditions, including non religious things such as medicine, astronomy, mathematics, surgery, etc.<br><br>There was also spiritual expansion from India, in particular buddhism which reached China and Japan. Before buddhism a lot of the far east was in continual war, whereas buddhism brought in a more peaceful attitude via concepts such as karma and also non injury (ahimsa) and united different nations via a common religion.<br><br>I think some of the indian conquest was peaceful via royals intermarrying, namely the legend you mention and the indian prince marrying a thai princess to found the modern thai royal family. The legend you mention sounds right, and would explain the similarities. Koreans arent just going to invent such a specific legend which also conforms with what was happening in other countries.<br><br>In europe also, there was expansion via royal marriage, where maybe they became allies rather than a conquest. eg Scotland got united with England via royal marriage, England was unable to defeat Scotland by war.<br><br>Modern history tends to be that broadcast by europe, especially England and Germany, but all that had to conform with the anglican and lutheran churches respectively, which said creation was 6000 years ago, and which will always dismiss any non christian accomplishments.<br><br>But with indian scriptures, they used an astronomical calender, and would give the date via the stars and planets, and because of the precession of the equinoxes, certain seasonal things gradually change with time, and indian scholars have been able to date scriptural references via the precession of the equinoces far further back than western historians give, where western history says nothing happened before some 6000 years ago. <br><br>the sanskrit language in particular is the most advanced human language ever, and is beyond the scope of most humans to speak,<br>the only people who can handle it adeptly are the brahmin priest caste of hinduism. Western scholars struggle with the language, and have to consult brahmins for whom the language is matter of fact.<br><br>And all the major languages of europe appear to be descended from sanskrit, including latin and greek. <br><br>Only languages such as hungarian + finnish, and basque are unrelated, hungarian + finnish + turkish are closely related and relate to Genghis Khan&#39;s mongol hordes, and are agglutinative languages (based on successive suffices) as are the red indian languages.<br>whereas sanskrit is vastly more sophisticated, similar to latin, but with much more structure than latin. Latin is a degenerated form of sanskrit.<br><br>europeans have then tried to deny this indian basis by looking for a PIE (proto indo european) language as a conjectured precursor for sanskrit, but there is no evidence for this conjecture EXCEPT sanskrit! Ultimately indus valley was THE original civilisation and the origin of sanskrit.<br><br>when the germans discovered that sanskrit was the root of even latin and greek, they became obsessed with sanskrit civilisation and began scouring India for everything relating to this, and did intense study, in particular the philosophy which ultimately led to german philosophy. All german academics would study the indian scriptures, eg the upanishads and gita. When Oppenheimer exploded the first atom bomb, he quoted from the hindu scriptures about &quot;I am become the destroyer of worlds&quot;. To quote like that is only possible if he had done intense study.<br><br>this study of sanskrit led to huge progress in Germany, the germans studied sanskrit civilisation then developed the ideas in their own direction.<br><br>in fact the chinese martial arts originate from the shaolin buddhist temples, where the monks were being taught yoga poses to show the mastery of the mind over the body. The chinese then developed this static practice into a dynamic practice for self defence. If you watch martial arts people, you will see they meditate briefly in a static pose before an explosion of violence. All physical action begins in the mind, and the more nerves you utilise the more power and control you get.<br><br>There is ginormous progress now in India, and India is closer to europe than all the far eastern countries. But they are nearer the US, the rise of China is partly because it is next door to the US. <br><br>chinese exports tend to be by ship otherwise too expensive, and these take a long time. Ships will reach europe quicker from India than from China, but chinese ships will reach the US faster. The US is ultimately a smaller market than Europe, the US is some 360 million people, europe is more than 540 million, and that excludes Russia. the population of India was 1.336 billion in 2019, so is larger than the EU + US combined and will soon overtake China which was 1.398  in 2019.<br><br>India has 2 advantages over the far eastern countries: nearer the bigger market of europe, and a better command of english. Far eastern people generally struggle with english, and also each far eastern country has a tricky language to learn. I wanted to email Samsung once, and it was impossible, the only portal was in the korean script!<br><br>western history will deny India and China any importance because they are non christian societies, it is religious prejudice.<br><br>but historically India was at the centre of the old world, and there was major trade by ship from India both to the far east and to arabia and the east african coast. Europe in fact was backward because it was more isolated from India for ships. europe was civilised by the romans, who were civilised by the greeks, but there is a lot of evidence that the greeks were civilised by their study of indian civilisation.<br>Greece originally was violent, then they came in contact with India via Alexander, and now became civilised.<br><br><br>european mathematics has its origins in India, where the greeks of Alexander the great brought the wisdom to the library at Alexandria in Egypt, and eg the decimal number system was an indian invention, which reached europe via the arabs. Before that it was roman numerals eg MCMLXXXIV instead of 1984. The concept of algorithm was from an arab Al kwarizmi, which he developed after studying the works of indian mathematics, which had the precursors. european steelmaking also has its origins in India, where the finest steel was indian, and famous british physicist Michael Faraday was assigned to reverse engineer it. But he was unable to, and they had to eventually use espionage to find how the indians made it. <br><br><a href=""https://www.currentscience.ac.in/Volumes/113/09/1792.pdf"">https://www.currentscience.ac.in/Volumes/113/09/1792.pdf</a><br><br>The ancient indians had a huge suite of surgical instruments, which needs quality steel, &quot;surgical steel&quot; and invented cataract surgery. Plastic surgery was another indian invention, where indians were doing nose transplants, and knew what herbs and oils to use to prevent the flesh getting infected. Europeans took the idea and renamed it with a latin name, rhinoplasty which makes it seem to be a european idea!<br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIuKuYZ-bd8"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIuKuYZ-bd8</a><br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGyjvyXEKdc&amp;t=5351s"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGyjvyXEKdc&amp;t=5351s</a><br><br>according to western history the oldest civilisations are Sumer and Indus, and Indus was far bigger than Sumer. Sumer is in the desert, but Indus was along a fertile river, where there was a conurbation civilisation stretching along a lot of the river. As well as other rivers such as saraswati. <br><br>both civilisations are older than ancient China. Historically all diamonds came from India, today there are other places eg South Africa,<br>but even the african diamonds are finished in India. There was extensive trade between Sumer and Indus, and there were bead factories in Indus whose exports reached a large zone of the old world, even reaching Japan.<br><br><a href=""https://www.harappa.com/video/textiles-and-basketry-indus-tradition-archaeological-evidence-and-historical-legacy"">https://www.harappa.com/video/textiles-and-basketry-indus-tradition-archaeological-evidence-and-historical-legacy</a><br><br><a href=""https://www.harappa.com/slideshows"">https://www.harappa.com/slideshows</a><br><br>In the year 1700, India was the biggest economy in the world, bigger than the entirety of western europe up till that point,<br><br><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_regions_by_past_GDP_(PPP)#1%E2%80%932008_(Maddison)"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_regions_by_past_GDP_(PPP)#1%E2%80%932008_(Maddison)</a><br><br>China was ahead only from around 1500, and India was ahead at 1700.

He didnt know what India was! The japanese will meticulously say the story of the buddha, yet are in denial of India!

So if you&#39;re poor and society breeds you into thinking that the only good way to live is a rich way, then of course you&#39;re going to exploit the rich, become a parasite to the parasite. The point is that there&#39;s no way to &quot;do it properly&quot; because exploitation and violence are necessary to bask in so much wealth.",singleoneonly,2021-07-27T19:30:15Z,0

"Thank you for this subliminal lesson on pro-socialism,  pro-Marxism, anti-capitalism, anti-white (commercial) anti-America (ofcourse the flag). The West already has been infested. I wonder what The Gardner will do about this. We all know the system is defect but this is not due to kapitalism but by greed and power by narcicistic, psychopathic powermongers who miss use capitalism, and try to take over the &#39;free&#39; west. When people speak of Kapitalism and the miss using of power i hardly see people talk about exploitation by China to their own people. Oman, Saudi Arabia and all those rich oil sjeiks.....No, it&#39;s almost always the West. <br><br>Esoterically speaking: Kapital is from the word &#39;caput&#39; which means &#39;head&#39;.

"That one scene where the poor family was hiding from the rich family in the living room so they don’t get caught, I really love the symbolism that came with it where it demonstrated the hierarchy between the rich and the poor and the power of privilege; where as the rich family were above the poor family(physically and in society) and they were just enjoying themselves and not worrying about anything while the poor family was beneath them(physically and in society) and they basically holding their breathe and struggling while also not trying to be noticed by the family (just the same way it works in capitalism where the rich(lots to the time) are the ones seen by the world and the ones we here about while the poor struggles but is still expected to keep their heads down and mouths shut just to get by in the world) so while the rich family is completely oblivious and doesn’t truly know what is really happening around them, only what it has to do with themselves, the poor family is aware of what is happening around them and even how the rich family talks about them.

The whole concept is flawed. There is no parasite here because a parasite takes only and gives nothing by definition. The poor receive pay and the rich receive a service. Both benefit. I don&#39;t care if they think they are entitled to more... they can think what they want but it is not true.

"Abel Abel  @Abel Abel    well first of all, if you make a claim you have the responsibility of substantiating it.<br><br>It would be like me saying &quot;China is evil&quot; and if it isnt then you have to prove it to me.<br>Thats not how it works, if I want to make a claim, i need to support it by saying &quot;China is evil because communism genocide concentration camps etc...&quot;<br><br>So i dont accept the premise in the first part of your response.<br>Secondly, for people who don&#39;t have access to internet or time, that&#39;s a different case because what I am claiming is if people have the internet people can&#39;t complain. And if someone says they don&#39;t even have an hour or two of spare time in their day then I don&#39;t believe them. Because otherwise i wouldn&#39;t be having that conversation. <br><br>I am not saying people should just die off. Theres welfare and unemployment benefits for that. <br><br>Thirdly , if 50 percent of world wealth is in the hands of a few people, whatre you gonna do? Steal it from them? It&#39;s about competence.<br>If someone feels that they are more competent than them then they can go ahead build something valuable and earn all that money for themselves.<br><br>Oh and another thing.<br>If you&#39;re making 300k a year after getting a PhD degree then sure, my competencies and economic utility of my skills are not nearly as good as yours.<br>That wouldn&#39;t make you an asshole that would make you correct.<br><br>You can look down on me or anyone you wish to. It doesn&#39;t harm anyone because no one cares.<br><br>We didn&#39;t invent a market, we invented trade and rhe market was a naturally occurring by product of that.<br><br>And why can&#39;t you understand the simple concept about trade? Example, <br>i anticipate that everyone would want a spoon. I get the idea that i can sell a lot of spoons when that happens, so i decide to invest in that idea by buying a lot of spoons, this in turn, makes me bearer of that risk.<br><br>Then when soup becomes popular and spoons are needed,  then I sell it to people and get more money.<br><br>The people benefit because they got a spoon to drink the soup with, and i benefit because I sold them at a higher price.<br>As the cost, i had the risk of that investment going to shit. And i came up with the idea.<br><br>I got money because I correctly predicted the worth of spoon or whatever. <br>Ridiculous example but there&#39;s no exploitation here and value is being generated. Everyone&#39;s happy. <br><br><br>Answering your other question, if everyone studies and becomes rich then what will happen, then due to more people being competent, that would generate so much wealth in the world that it would drive down the cost of everything, leading to the relative living standards the same as they are now and in absolute terms, better.",Ratatoskr's Adoring Fan,2021-07-14T14:34:05Z,0

Not the people themselves.<br><br>Every one is paid what they are worth, otherwise why wouldn&#39;t they leave?<br>Maybe because they know that switching jobs isn&#39;t gonna get them a better deal because their skills really aren&#39;t worth that much to anyone.",Ratatoskr's Adoring Fan,2021-07-14T12:07:57Z,0

"A film that criticizes capitalism, selling the idea that capitalism is evil, that the rich are evil, when both rich and poor are interdependent.

"No no no.  You are missing the most important facts.  Capitalism DID provide upward mobility, and where anyone who worked could become wealthy and own their own house and car.  It was when plank #5 of communism, CENTRAL BANKS, and the separation of the dollar from being backed by precious metals that this changed, and indeed if you look at the 60&#39;s, there really was upward mobility.  Capitalism lost its legitimacy, and ceased to be capitalism when bankers acquired the power to create credit out of thin air with which to purchase capital.  That&#39;s when we transformed into a caste system which put those in proximity to control over the money supply at the top.  Bankers intentionally create boom and bust cycles through debt in order to impoverish people, and then they leverage the poverty for political power so that they can establish authoritarian regimes which they control, effectively making them kings.  This also exposes &quot;right wing&quot; lies that investors take the risk, when in fact they receive subsidies, bailouts, etc, transferring their losses in the stock market to the general public through taxes and inflation.  The &quot;left wing&quot; lies are that we have capitalism.  We don&#39;t.. and we haven&#39;t for a long time.  Not since central banks and the government started centrally planning economies.

"I don&#39;t agree with the idea in this movie.  Social inequality and oppression have existed long before late capitalism and is in fact an inherent feature of any society from any time or place.  <br><br>I also do not agree with basic premise of the movie, portraying both the rich and the poor as parasites of each other.  If anything the societal cohabitation between the two &quot;classes&quot; (although I find the word tasteless and only used to provoke controversy) is more akin to mutualism than parasitism.  The one only exists in relationship to the other -- the more rich you have then the more poor you have and vice versa.  For example, take a look at Singapore, a major financial and shipping hub in East Asia -- lots of rich and lots of poor.  Check out the living conditions of the some the people on Youtube -- some places are so atrocious that it cant be filmed. <br><br>But again, while the director was no doubt masterful in execution of his vision, his philosophic premise falls short to convince me of the reality of world.

"@Karl Snarks  thanks for the thoughtful responses. I hear the infrastructure argument a lot but I don&#39;t necessarily agree. Everyone has equal access to the roads, power grid, labor, etc. so those who are able to take advantage of that shared resource to obtain wealth shouldn&#39;t owe anyone else unless they use unfair or exploitative methods.  <br><br>I agree that Marx wasn&#39;t all about pure equality...I was just generalizing because most arguments for socialism have soft, undefined (in my opinion) outcomes. Is there a definition of poverty so we can recognize when it&#39;s been eliminated? What does &quot;living wage&quot; mean?  One can argue that those in poverty are making a living wage since they&#39;re not dead (I know I&#39;m being cheeky here to make a point). I&#39;m all for reducing suffering with the understanding that a) we can&#39;t help everyone and b) every mission must have defined, objective end state.  <br><br>I&#39;m not sure worker&#39;s co-ops are the best format either as I feel there are a lot of inefficiencies in that system. How would large scale production or trade work?  How about cooperation or coordination to manufacturing components which will be assembled at another location/co-op?  How would innovation work if one research facility is dependent on the work of another?  Etc.

"About your note on smell at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgAK-4kPTb8&amp;t=6m06s"">6:06</a> , I wanted to share an excerpt from George Orwell&#39;s Road to Wigan Pier. Orwell observed that smell is used as a physical, palpable barrier between classes. <br><br>&quot;But there was another and more serious difficulty. Here you come to the real secret of class distinctions in the West – the real reason why a European of bourgeois upbringing, even when he calls himself a Communist, cannot without a hard effort think of a working man as his equal. It is summed up in four frightful words which people nowadays are chary of uttering, but which were bandied about quite freely in my childhood. The words were:  <b>The lower classes smell</b> .<br>That was what we were taught – the  lower classes smell .And here, obviously,  you are at an impassable barrier.  For no feeling of like or dislike is quite so fundamental as physical feeling. Race-hatred, religious hatred, differences of education,  of temperament,  of intellect,  even differences of moral code, can be got over; but physical repulsion can not. You can have an affection for a murderer or a sodomite, but you cannot have an affection for a man whose breath stinks – habitually stinks, I mean. However well you may wish him, however much you may admire his mind and character, if his breath stinks he is horrible and in your heart of hearts you will hate him.&quot;",Yin Yang Logo,2021-06-06T04:51:25Z,30

"In my mind, the unfairness of capitalism comes with access to information. Capitalism has done me very well in my life, so in that respect, I may be biased, but I believe that you can put someone who knows about money, in the poorest part of the poorest country they could work their way out, but only with the knowledge acquired from the western world. If you swapped a rich person and poor person&#39;s money around, the previously rich person would catch up, and the now rich person would likely lose the money. If the world was to be truely capitalistic in the way that it is intended, information should be available everywhere for those that want it. With the internet, almost everyone in the western world has access to all the information that any one person could ever ask for, but in places like these, I can&#39;t say that I&#39;m sure that someone could make it out. Capitalism as a concept only works with equal opportunity, obviously equal opportunity will never be possible, luck will always be a factor no matter what, but the world can strive for a base level of equal opportunity, which is an efficient and well thought out education system for everyone that gives genuinely useful information to a child as they are growing up.

Then you will reach rich status (might noth be rich in money, but will be enough in money and rich in soul)!<br>And please stop with the socialist bullshit how the rich are stealing from the poor.

"It&#39;s interesting how the movie or in life, we bind the amount of assets a human owns to the nature and morals of the same human without reviewing the global big data across infinite data points and treating the the variables of wealth, poverty, good, average, bad, evil, saint, as discrete. Crudely put, there&#39;s good rich people, there&#39;s bad rich people, there&#39;s good poor people, there&#39;s bad poor people. Holistically, if everything is for free and without controls globally, and in consideration of the sociopathic and psychopathic tendencies in the human population, our Earth&#39;s natural and man made resources will quickly run out, where the &quot;winners&quot; left without any resources to consume will eventually and inevitably die out ending in the extinction of the human race.

"The thing that neither the movie nor any similar argument have is a call to action, and there&#39;s a good reason for it. The message isn&#39;t &quot;overthrow capitalism,&quot; the message is futility. It&#39;s hard to hear that because we already know that the problem is 100% caused by human nature, and we tend to think that we have mastery over our own nature. But we don&#39;t. What can you do? It&#39;s not just futile because you&#39;re under the boot, but it&#39;s futile even when you&#39;re on top. As the video showed, owning an iPhone puts you on top, and even people struggling to feed their kids have an iPhone. Will Apple care if you boycott their products? Will you save a single sweatshop worker from stubbing their toe at work? Probably not. So what if you were Steve Jobs? Maybe then you could summon inhuman strength to defy your nature and shut it all down, but the people you displace will just move over you and become you. If you&#39;re somewhere in the middle, like you probably are, you can keep most of what you have by giving to a charity that will squander your money in bureaucracy and greed, or you can throw away what you have by buying a gun to go kill your local rich person, and then the media will make it a tragedy, and despite everything it actually is one, and then it becomes fuel on the fire. But what you&#39;ll probably do given that those two options suck is just cover your nose and live your life.",Felix,2021-05-22T04:41:12Z,0

They don&#39;t realize that it&#39;s an incredible opportunity for people in other countries and that taking away said &quot;poverty job&quot; replaces an evil for a WORSE evil not a good by default. It happened to us when I was 11. one day we had a home and food, then the next thing you know some college kid activists from the US came and got the plant that my parents worked at shut down because the working conditions were &quot;too harsh&quot; by their standards even though they didnt even live in the same country. They basically flew in, marched around for a few weeks, got the plant shut down then flew back out leaving us with nothing and no solution. We literally had nothing to eat after that and lost our home :/. Soon after my grandmother got sick from pneumonia because we had to sleep in boxes on the street and she basically ended up starving to death.

"It&#39;s not exploitation if you agree to work there under the terms you sign. If you don&#39;t like your work, leave and find a better one. If you can&#39;t find a job, that&#39;s that. No one owes you any work. If you force your employer with rules so that they hire you and give you your ideal work, it is by definition exploitation. Capitalism is based on consent. Two parties have to agree to come to a transaction, whether if that&#39;s buying a product, a service, or a wage. In econ, it&#39;s called the labor market. And like every market, there&#39;s a market price for every job. Companies buy worker&#39;s time and productivity and compensate them with an income. How much that amount of work that the worker has to provide for the amount the business is willing to pay is negotiable on every individual case. Choosing any side and write laws to give that side benefits that wouldn&#39;t have taken place if not backed by the full force of the law, while justifying it with &quot;good intentions&quot;, its exploitation. The road to hell is paved with good intentions. Think in terms of reality, not in your personal ideals or emotions.",nopetanker,2021-05-18T11:29:40Z,0

"I&#39;ve never bought into the idea that this was about class struggle.  This was a story about a family of freeloaders who victimized a richer family.  The terrible sin that the rich family did was to say that one of their member&#39;s stink.  The poor family betrays friends, they steal, they lie, they poison people, hurt (and kill) other people, they have no problem ruining lives and careers of other people, they use deception to take advantage of a teenage girl, and ultimately they use violence when they are offended.  In the end, they spend the rest of the movie escaping the consequences of their decisions.  They are upset by what they see in the mirror, not by anything anyone else has done to them.  They are not victims of society, they experience the ramifications of their choices and blame others.  They are more likely to use their obvious talents to cheat the system than to actually achieve within it.",J Barnes,2021-05-18T11:29:04Z,0

"TLDR; Asian beauty standards are not eurocentric, there are historical, and much more local cultural reasons behind them. Thinking that Asian beauty standards must be because of eurocentrism, is in fact an eurocentric point of view.<br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>I disagree with beauty standards in Asia being &quot;eurocentric&quot;. The ideal of having paler skin comes in fact from the difference in skin tone that peasants had from working in the fields being darker, and the nobility who didn&#39;t do manual labor outside being much more pale. Other more &quot;European features&quot; being idealized, such as having a stronger or higher nose bridge etc, come from Asian people having more rounded and flatter facial features. So I personally feel that thinking that Asian beauty standards must be because of &quot;eurocentrism&quot;, is in itself an eurocentric point of view, at least when it comes to Asian beauty standards.<br><br>There are other differences in beauty standards between cultures as well.<br>If Asia followed European standards of beauty, would they not taking advantage of being able to tan more easily? In Europe being tanned seems to be the ideal, especially with young women these days (sure way to get skin cancer btw). <br><br>One other difference is that for example in Japan, being muscular for men isn&#39;t the seen as the ideal (although recently there has been a fitness boom in Japan as well). Most Japanese women, when asked, said that they preferred at most a skinny fit body for men, rather than the roided-out bodybuilder action-star look of hollywood actors, which is  arguably seen as the pinnacle of male-beauty in the west.<br><br>A while back there was an article stating that anime and manga is being drawn following eurocentric ideals, when in fact it just to give a stronger distinction between characters, making things more colorful, and it is a matter of stylization.<br><br>Thinking that the whole world revolves around the west is a small-minded and eurocentric way of looking at things.<br><br>Otherwise this was an insightful video.",thisiswhereitakemytrash,2021-05-10T14:09:20Z,0

"@ Michael Jay <br>The rich already pay more for it. It’s the rich in any country that are gonna be business owners who pay the salaries of their employees. It’s also the rich who by and large already pay the majority of taxes that  help to fund the country, at least in the states. So are you saying that they should pay even more? Why? Won’t that incentivize them to start investing in places that aren’t going to tax them as much and thereby taking industry away from our country, costing people their jobs? It sounds great in theory, but employees in some capacity sometimes get more than they deserve, granted that’s also not usually the case. For example, former GM employees were given many benefits that GM couldn’t continue to afford, and so the obvious solution is to cut costs by removing benefits and cutting down on the staff. This may sound unfair, but realistically it won’t be possible to provide jobs to all one’s employees if cost of work and labor exceeds profits. And GM doesn’t have infinite money, or even enough to continuously proceed with such a trend for a limited time, that’s how businesses go bankrupt. That’s also why GM has been slowly paying for giving in to the unions ever since the 70’s.",JustSomeGuyWhoWantsAMustache,2023-05-06T02:47:52Z,0

"I feel like this takes a pretty un-nuanced view at the nature of economics and society. Modern capitalist societies are the best places to be on the planet, especially for the poor - seeing how the productive economic activity allows for the expansion of social services and better all-around infrastructure. Many young people in the West don&#39;t realize how good they actually have it. I was born in a pretty poor post-soviet country and I&#39;m incredibly thankful for the opportunities afforded in places like the US. I feel like Marxian analysis is somewhat lacking in wisdom and is largely based on a pre-existing feeling of hatred/jealousy for those with more than others rather than a rigorous analysis of the nature of economics (I&#39;m looking at you labor theory of value and exploitation theory)<br><br>It&#39;s very easy for us to point at factories in poor countries, but let&#39;s consider than the alternative is that nobody invested in that area at all, resulting no job, rather than a factory job. Anyway I could go on forever. I think this movie is a good look at the behavior of individuals, but I think it&#39;s sort of misplaced to try to make it into some grandiose statement about capitalism.",Yeg0r7,2021-05-05T16:24:30Z,0
"@Jack Middleton I&#39;d say that the people who say this tend to take a cursory look at the state of what they see in a poor town or in a poor area and make short-sighted conclusions. The idea that capitalism &quot;requires&quot; or thrives off of poor people isn&#39;t an accurate one but the logic of the claim is that capitalism requires a dynamic in which there is an ownership class and a working class. A person who owns a factory does not have to physically engage in the labor of producing goods in a factory, but they benefit from the profit generated from the labor they hire. <br><br>Capitalism itself, as a term, is incredibly vague, but it&#39;s typically defined as an economic system where productive property can be owned in private hands. People who criticize capitalism tend to take a Marxist perspective, so they believe that the very act of profit is exploitative because it means you&#39;re &quot;stealing&quot; surplus value that is generated by a worker. The problem with such an analysis is that it uses what is called the &quot;labor theory of value&quot; when in reality the value of commodities is completely subjective. There is a lot to this, so I won&#39;t write a whole book in this comment section, but feel free to ask further questions if you have them.<br><br>I&#39;ll just leave you with a simple example to give you an idea of what I mean. A typical critic of capitalism would look at a clothing factory in a poorer country like India or Bangladesh and say &quot;Hey, the business owner is exploiting these poor people and paying them a low wage&quot; First of all I would invite this individual to look at GDP per capita data in Bangladesh and India, to see that they&#39;re becoming richer by the year thanks for foreign investment, but I&#39;d also put in in perspective. Imagine you live in a poor area with no job opportunities, and the only real option for you is subsistence farming. If someone from a foreign country decides to invest money to build a factory in your town and offer to pay people to work there - that is an absolute gain to everyone involved. The poor people in the town now have access to a job that didn&#39;t exist before, that pays more than subsistence farming, and the factory owner gets access to a labor market that is likely cheaper than in their home market - meaning people in their home country will have access to less expensive clothing - it&#39;s a win all around. This is associated with the economics principle of &quot;comparative advantage&quot;.<br><br>Anyway, that&#39;s what I&#39;d say for now on the matter. Most of the people who say things like that either haven&#39;t seriously seen the faults in marxist theory, or are frankly just jealous of people who are successful and generally worked hard to get to where they are (80+% of American millionaires are self-made)",Yeg0r7,2021-05-06T01:08:11Z,0

"I never saw anyone point out about that one scene in the beginning where the family was folding pizza boxes. They saw a videoof a woman folding the boxes faster... and they did try to do it while they were at it there was this extermination thing yet the father said not to close the window, the family and their home ended up being cover in all that gas or fog the father kept doing what the woman in the video was doing while the rest were coughing, having a hard time to breathe. In the end they 1 out of 4 boxes were rejects. I feel like it&#39;s a metaphor how they chose the easier path to be employed. They built a tower of lies. The father symbolizes the whole family, the box symbolizes their life and current social status while the video symbolizes as their goal to escape poverty. They did not care what will happen if something would go wrong they kept lying to the park family thinking that they&#39;ll never be discovered. They didn&#39;t give a single care if they&#39;re doing something wrong.

I think the guy who termed cool capitalism was simply political. The true foundational basis without politics can be found reading Plato&#39;s &quot;The Cave&quot;. Because the guy who termed Cool Capitalism was more political than scholarly he does not put into the consideration that whether it is capitalism, or Plato&#39;s enlightenment; both are essential NOT important.

Because... duh UNFAIRNESS. <br><br>This movie is a parasite, sucking off the teat of capitalism in order to get an audience. Exploiting the disaffection of the less capable and the guilt of the more gullible.<br><br>Or else it&#39;s just a well-crafted if preachy parable declaring the obvious: that everyone in an advanced capitalist society depends on the labor of others to obtain things they need and want and the distribution of those things is not equal and only relatively fair.<br><br>Head Smack followed by Face Palm.",TomK.,2021-04-28T15:58:13Z,0

"Serious question:<br>Can someone pls help me understand how it&#39;s really the rich family that&#39;s the real parasite, as they live of the work of the poor family?<br><br>I do realize that the movie is a metaphor for class inequality, but in this specific case: the Park family, apart from being clueless, arrogant a$$holes are not really exploiting anyone. The poor family are hired and paid to drive a car, cook food and tutor the kids. How exactly does the work of a chauffeur, a cook and 2 tutors translate in the Parks living a luxurious life?  It&#39;s not like the Parks can&#39;t drive their own car, cook their own food and do homework with their kids. Having someone else do that for them gives them more free time and confort, but it hardly makes them ultra rich.<br><br>The rich dad owns an advertising company from what I remember. His employees ( the people whos work help him make money ) are white collar: copywriters, creative directors, designers etc. His company&#39;s paying customers are business owners who are rich enough to pay for their services. So it&#39;s not like he&#39;s running a sweatshop. <br><br>If there are nuances that I&#39;m missing about this specific case I&#39;d really like to know.",jf we,2021-04-28T10:25:21Z,2

This is a symbolism of how low the poor class is force to live in the society and how they are perceived. The lowest point possible. Below sewer level, and this point of view is stronger when you realize the rich family house is on a uphill, on top of the city giving his great view. Also an extra detail is to think that for something so basic and necessary like a toilet, they have to be in such a tiny, uncomfortable place.",Roxer777,2021-04-15T09:46:09Z,1

This is because inequality is much more... tangible(?) there. At least there are things to blame in the USA. Where you live, skin color, immigrant generation, etc but in Korea, a homogeneous society in a country the size of Ohio... well inequality between Koreans is... well just plain inequality. Also Korea is a weird place where in the city of Seoul, one of the world&#39;s biggest megalopolises, has basement rooms with luxury apartments just across the alleyway, old toilets that you have to squat to use right next to modern American Standard toilets with bidet attachment. Some parts of the city sparkle while other parts look like they never left the 70s. At least we can try a different city, a different state.

But in one direction it&#39;s necessity, in the other direction it&#39;s just convenience.<br><br>Tbh I don&#39;t remember if they are part of a huge corporation so this point might be invalid, but since that video has drawn these conclusions I just figured that they do.",DerAltruist,2021-09-17T08:50:21Z,2

"I agree with most of what was said in this video. Except one of the major points that was made. You stated that it is not really an option for the poor to aspire to having wealth and becoming rich, but this is simply untrue for millions of poor people. My father was a part of the lower class in my country (not in North America, Europe or any developed country by the way) growing up with what was necessary to live a life without physical suffering, but he never had more than enough and he had to come out of a town which had high crime rates. Today my dad is wealthy and owns his own companies. You try to say as a fact that coming out of poverty and that the American dream is just a lie sold to the people, but for millions across the world, and definitely for South Korea since it is a moderately developed country, it is indeed possible to become rich and to create wealth. If a child decides to do the best they can in school (if the opportunity is granted to them) they would generally be capable of going to college if they excel in their studies during highschool, and I don&#39;t say this baselessly. Even in my country if a kid graduates from his/her highschool with exemplary results they are capable of going to college which would allow them to generate money in a variety of ways. Not just this, but 88% percent of millionaires today are self-made and 80% of millionaires reported starting out with nothing. It may take Ki-woo nearly 600 years to come up with the money he needs to buy the house, but that doesn&#39;t take into account what it is that he does for a living or the potential he has doing something else. Some people are luckier than others when it comes to where they are born, but for most of us, with hard work, WE CAN DO ANYTHING! If you read all the way to here, don&#39;t let this video tell you that the American Dream is just an illusion and that there isn&#39;t any way for you to build wealth and become rich. If you work hard enough and study how to make money, you can do it.",Marco Santana,2021-04-07T18:48:06Z,0
"Abel Abel You dont have to work hard and thats it. You have to study what it is that makes the most money for the time you spend. If u decide to work hard everyday working construction u will always be poor. If you work hard at a labor job and study how to make money with marketing for example, eventually that can be your full time job and then u wont be poor. People have to asses what it is they do before saying that they don’t make enough despite working hard.

@Gratefully Positive not really. saying &quot;Being thankful about your daily life is helpful to help those who are in need.&quot; is complete fucking bullshit. there&#39;s a difference between being thankful for what you have and recognizing it&#39;s the bare minimum. being thankful you have a bed to sleep on isn&#39;t going to help those who don&#39;t have a bed because you aren&#39;t acknowledging WHY people don&#39;t have beds. being thankful isn&#39;t going to help anyone; acknowledging why you feel the need to be thankful is,Yee Yee,2021-06-17T05:51:59Z,2
@v i disagree. Being thankful should also be a part of the norm you are talking about. Being thankful about your daily life is helpful to help those who are in need. Being thankful helps to be positive about your own life instead of picking at everything. It’s just a way of life that we can all agree or disagree with. It’s which side of the coin you wanna choose.

"what i leant from this movie, mentality decides whether or not you are rich or poor. the poor family all got jobs in the end, but wanted more out of greed. Even if they weren&#39;t technically poor anymore and had a steady income. And those rich people had everything yet they acted like lowly people. human beings are terrible",Deanster,2021-04-07T12:21:51Z,1
"Abel Abel of course i see youre frustrated but that is humanity and the harsh reality we face everyday. although i don&#39;t agree that people who try to be positive or turning their negatives into beneficial things are stupid or ignorant. theyre very smart. Like that family they worked hard and got their moment of happiness, they didn&#39;t let themselves be crippled by the thought that they are unworthy of good things.",Deanster,2021-04-08T11:33:10Z,0
"Abel Abel well its easy to see that everyday. sometimes poor people or people who live in rural areas try to be positive with (not saying that ok) living simply and when you ask if they&#39;re suffering they say they are blessed with whatever they have . from the outside perspective we see them poor hopeless souls and should be unhappy all the time but sometimes from their perspective they are more grateful from what little that comes their way. its a positive outlook and sometimes poor people can be some of the most kindest people ever. thats why i said mentality does keep one poor, you can even say a negative mentality can keep one poor physically and mentally. like the movie, before they were poor physically but when money and success came in you will see that the mentality of being poor before pushed them to continue to want more. they didnt want to go back even if they had to hurt people. what they failed to see was that they had achieved some stable ground already and should have humbly chosen to use the opportunity to better themselves instead they still had the mentality of manipulating others because they are &quot;poor&quot;. our mentality affects us and the lives we live.",Deanster,2021-04-08T01:20:50Z,0

"I dont know, I watched the movie and had a lot of mixed feelings. But I understand that the poor family were leechs, with intelligence, but unsustainable in the long run. By the other side, the Parks provided job, we never know how many the paid was or for how much time, but characters showed like the pay was good. I can critic their snobish behaviour and lack of humbleness. But everyones lives their reality, I cant expect them to start giving free money to solve problem they dont have the fault. I would prefer they give job opportunity to these people with have a lack of it.<br>As an argument about an opinion you expressed. I do believe that working with intelligence, you can move forward in your social class and wellbeing, and for doing so, you dont need to push down no one, but to learn how to sell a product or service who attract a buy with higher or almost same income as you. I understand that capitalism isnt a flawless model, but it sure works.",Ariel C,2021-04-06T07:00:51Z,0

"I think that the movie shed some light on the widening gap between haves and have-nots, but i disagree with most of the interpretation. The Parks don&#39;t leech off of poor people, the father works on a tech company, how is that parasitic?  you may be right to assume that rich people have an advantage in the exchange of value for labor, but i don&#39;t find this to be a parasitic relationship. The worker gets money, the factory gets labor. And while you may think that this is completely one sided it is mostly through this kind of exchanges that china has become a powerful country(for example). <br><br>Also this idea that it is impossible for poor people to become rich is just about the most ridiculous thing in this video.  Rich people squander and lose their fortunes all the time, and poor people rise to be wealthy all the time as well. I&#39;m only saying this because i&#39;ve seen with my own eyes the process through which people who have next to nothing manage to buy multiple houses and live very comfortably.  it would take 564 years for the kid to buy the house if he did the exact same unproductive thing for all that time, but that is not the only thing he could do.<br><br>Capitalism is not completely good and like everything else can become bad if left unchecked, but the governments have an even worse history of managing the economy. also this idea that the poor are poor because of capitalism is also ridiculous, the places that you&#39;re criticizing are the places to which millions of people from other countries try to get to while losing everything in the process, sometimes even their lives. They do this because they know that even that deal is a lot better than what&#39;s going on in their own countries and because they know that it is one of the most effective ways to rise out poverty there is.<br><br>I do understand that some countries should not be interfering so much with the political systems of other countries but..... was that you giving a jab at the spread of democracy? i hope not.<br><br>While i disagree with your interpretation, the video itself was well edited and the way you presented your ideas was good too.<br><br>for the record, no, i&#39;m not a conservative.",Sir-Dorian,2021-04-02T07:07:11Z,0

The Kim family is manipulative, and possibly criminal because their survival depends on it. In my opinion, that is where the nuance ends. <br>Is western capitalism, or neoliberalism the primary reason for the decline of humanity, if there is indeed a decline? Or it merely serves to spectacularly magnify the unpleasant aspects of innate human behavior? I don&#39;t pretend to know the answers. But Mr.  Joon-Ho sure does.

"Great movie. It’s no surprise that a Korean director familiar with S. Korea’s harsh capitalistic society made this kind of movie. <br><br>Having one of the most rigorous university entrance exams and averaging the highest weekly working hours, all this results in high suicide rate, brutal turnover rate in white collar jobs, and edgy people with irritable personalities.

I, a foreigner who’s lived and worked there, can attest to the harsh life there. <br><br>It’s normal for white collar workers to have their careers END in their early 30’s. In need to provide for their families, many of theses workers start their own businesses. One of the common businesses is restaurants. S. Korea has more family owned restaurants per capita than any other country in the world.

"These comments are full of people trying to defend one family or the other, or trying to claim one side is more of a Parasite than the other. That&#39;s not the point - The point is that both families are doing these terrible things because it&#39;s what they feel they must do to succeed. Both families did things that many would not consider morally permissible, but the point is not to compare the moral permissibility of each families&#39; actions, it&#39;s to show the reasons why either one of the families felt the need to be that way in the first place.

"@jada rosaline Well the story of Parasite is two poor families (one a bit better off) fighting each other while the rich steal from both of them, and are idolised. During the movie the Kim’s think about how appreciative they are of the Park’s for letting them stay at their house, and the guy in the cellar worships a poster of Mr Park and turns on the lights for him everyday, which Mr Park thinks is just a feature of the house.<br><br>The Kim’s would rather tie up two people and kill them rather than defy the powerful upper class who look down on them. The height in the movie represents position in class, which is why the poor people stay down in the cellar. <br><br>When Choong-Sook kicks Mun-Kwang (the maid) down the stairs into the cellar, she asserts her higher place in class onto her. Mun-Kwang’s feels duty to worship Choong-Sook as she is now so much more powerful than her. She would rather do that than see the malicious intent behind her actions.",Jacob C,2021-06-15T16:22:09Z,60

"While everyone seems content on focusing on symbolism and class warfare aspects of the movie, one important thing is not being paid attention to: the moral atrocity of the Kim family. In my experience, it is actually the first part of the movie that I find highly disturbing: how parasitic and diabolical the actions of Kim family are. Imagine being given a job then taking that opportunity to constantly deceive your employer, taking the jobs of hardworking and honest people who have been in good service for years. <br><br>The second part of the movie is actually my saving grace: because it is the part where I feel like Kim family is about to get what they deserved for all their morally disturbing actions, especially when the old housekeeper found out about them and shot it on camera. It is even more disturbing to find out that the mother of Kim family is willing to kill someone for the purpose of hiding their real identities. I’m not convinced by what the mother said, referring to the mother of Parks family, that she’s not rich because she’s nice but “nice because she’s rich”. There are many rude and parasitic wealthy elites as much as there are lots of morally exemplary middle class, and even poor, people. Poverty is never an excuse to deceive people and rob other good people of their jobs, simply for the reason that “poor people need something to eat.”<br><br>All in all, Parasite is a once-in-a-lifetime experience of a movie. It is something that will disturb you while at the same time making you blown away by how deep, multi-faceted and intricate it is. It absolutely deserves all the accolades it receives.",Philosophy That Matters,2021-02-21T10:24:36Z,1

&quot;Living comfortably off the backs of their labor&quot;. Right. Labor that they paid for. Money in exchange for a service. How is that being a parasite exactly? Every analysis of this movie seems to say that the rich family is just as morally reprehensible as the poor family but thats a load of shit. The poor people were conniving manipulators and literal murderers. The rich people were a little snobby. That&#39;s it. Not to mention the fact that the rich family owned a highly lucrative technology company that I&#39;m sure they built through blood sweat and tears and which undoubtedly provides some benefit to society overall. The poor people were clearly the parasites.,MoMoneyLessProblems,2021-02-17T22:38:45Z,6

"What&#39;s really fascinating is the fact that the themes depicted in the film seem to be reflected in real life. It may seem like PARASITE seemed to have hijacked the Oscars just like the Kim family. The irony of taking 4 Oscars representing the 4 family members. The movies address growing class tensions in modern society which I believe in something that also happens in the film industry. The idea that any foreign film are marginalized to the bottom with one award nomination. You begin to see how the Oscars are also a &quot;parasite&quot; that reap and lives off the labour of foreign films. They are fully aware on the impact the award show has on films, so they expect to receive numerous film applications which in return gives them a massive viewership on the award night. The Oscars&#39; ignorance is fully shown when they don&#39;t bother to involve the cast or crew in any award nominations. <br><br>The Park family displays their physical aversion to the smell of the Kim family. A big symbol on Oscars&#39; strong distaste for foreign language in cinema. It is very clear that the Oscars want nothing to do with anything foreign and fully draw a line on their sophisticated world and don&#39;t want anyone crossing it. It&#39;s very clear they fear being exposed of their privilege which is something that is finally coming to light.",arthur,2021-02-16T08:08:54Z,0

"While I agree that capitalism is toxic and most of what you say is on point, pointing the blame on conservative norms and ideals when socialist regimes throughout history have used the morally high ground to exert authority and power is telling to the notion that people are so hung up on being morally good rather than going for what is required, competent governance.

"I never watched this movie but I think ill try to be the voice of reason here.  Of how wrong the views of this person is.      <br>Some of the things she got right is the Elite class.  The rich as she calls it does this.   Use the poor and others to do their bidding and usually have all the rules rigged to benefit them.   Accidents some times happen thought <b>ahem*. for those of you who are not completely blind to whats actually going on right now.      Corporatism is the new normal and the united states is to blame for this MOSTLY.     Others would say a banking family is what started all this but *ahem</b> most people consider that conspiracy theory.     Today you can easily Link most mega corporations and mega banks to very horrible deeds! yes, and these deeds are all about profit and power.    <br><br>Now what she has wrong.   Capitalism is Not what we are seeing today.  Capitalism is actually the best bad system humanity has ever made and has created many nations that do well still today and has lifted millions out of poverty.  Millions in a world of billions not good but better then the other choices we currently have.   It also however creates failing states and in a sense is what world trade is ruled by even now.  Some of these dictatorships you hear about only have One resource to captivate and sell on the global market meaning their citizens will never experience the same pleasures you and I experience.    To understand this better your need to understand the rules every leader needs to follow if they wish to KEEP or HOLD power.       Every state and nation has some capitalism in it other wise they would just fail.      What people keep getting wrong is Corporatism being confused as capitalism.           Yes the corporations are using the capitalist method, but they are also Posing as a state/nation.    A nation or state is a Government power ruled by the few.   Look at history books and you see all about loyalty,Honor and duty to the state  And betrayal, power grabs and revolts from the state.        What do we see today?   The very same thing in corporations.     The bigger the corporation is the more power they wield on states and Nations.    Its at the point where some mega corporations have regional power if they were a nation.     This is what we should fear this is the real monster the USA has unleashed on the world.         I am very unsure if it can be stopped with out major action and reaction from national powers. <br><br>This is why nationalism is making a comeback people are starting to wake up and realize the real danger of globalization.       When you lose the ability to make your own stuff you become a slave and depending on the people making it.   Who controls all our stuff?   Corporations and corporations need slave labor to keep profits and expand power.      This is the real scary monster.       But lets not kid our self&#39;s here.    Those of you specifically college age kids NEED to study the Horrors of Communism.     Regardless of the evils of corporatism and its for sure bad.   IT still not as bad as PURE GENOCIDE.     And china is the worse offender of this today having done so over 3 times now to their own people.     How many people have to die before people start realizing the evils of the world are In your own backyard in your class and in your society.     people need to STEP back and stop thinking with emotion and start realizing there is NO pretty picture and not real solutions with out Localization and building.     Dont expect others to solve your own problems.<br><br>Also id like to point out what some one else commented on.   &quot;Another lesson that can be drawn out of this is how easily the &quot;rags-to-riches&quot; individuals tend to forget their roots or where they started from. The Kims, once they are secured in their jobs and view themselves as moving up the wealth ladder, act the part of the rich. They dismiss the former cook&#39;s pleas to help her and her husband, despite the fact that they are similar. But another aspect that drew me to this conclusion was their initial dismissal of the rain&quot;      All those so called SUCCESSFUL people in the world.   most of them NEVER FORGOT their roots and treated every day as possibility going back to that poor life.    That motivation made them do and sacrifice and never gave up.   A routine most of you don&#39;t even have the courage to do.     SO a socialist system penalizing people like that will KILL society and create another Nazi Germany or worse!  a communist state.     Were everyone does as little as possible because anyone who gains attention will have to tip toe around glass shards or be killed.     A nation like that leads to mass starvation and mass deaths and stuff you all would be horrified to no end to experience.     Things people complain about now bullying, rape, and Racism.

If a person don&#39;t understand this film or simply find it boring to watch  this could possibly means that they&#39;re too Previlege to understand or be interested in this kind of thing. A response like &quot;I didn&#39;t get the movie.&quot; Speaks for itself.  People on a higher level usually don&#39;t see what&#39;s happening to the people below them or even if they did they would just simply ignore it.,pidsleyyy,2021-02-09T15:59:47Z,0

"​@Yee Yee Were reapeting over and over what Im saying. You are not understanding my point, the system you think is as simple you want it to be, nor facts you think are caused by a single individual or a single root cause for everything. The problem we are facing here is NOT one, but multiple complex factors, and more factors if we divulge into those said factors. We have the capabilities to feed everyone, but how can we achieve that goal? These road blocks are not only by the government, but by also individuals, paper work, laws, political, cultural, economy, and above all else, logistics. <br><br>You cannot proclaim to politics, or any system thats not capitalism and say with the audacity that these systems or road blocks can be &quot;simply&quot; remove, our system from big or small has road blocks for reasons, some dumb, some logical, and some complex that I have little to no background to say what those are. <br><br>And again and I will repeat this again, It IS 2 ways from my experience, my entire family was literally started from humble origins, some of my folks reasoning are due to my past family poor choice of education, availability of work, and more deeper reasons. This is what im saying, its not only the systems at fault here, we have to look pass that and see the individuals. Whats the point of changing or pointing out the system&#39;s flaws if we ignore human error? Not upper class people, but all people. From the poor, middle, and upper. Because we are the system here. <br><br>I am left with this, because we are neither getting any ground of a solid foundation, please, if you have the time.

We have the ability to solve the problem, but we have multiple road blocks to reach that point. Political, geography, beucracy, culutural, efficiency, and logistically. And thats juat the tip of what our system is. Even if we are able to feed people, its just a temporary solution to a much more complex situation. <br><br>Feeding the poor is not a final solution to poverty, it delves deeper into economics, infrustructure, and family.

"metaphors i noticed:<br><br>- mrs park mentions how her son thought he saw a ghost when he saw maid’s husband = rich dehumanise the poor into entities not actual people<br>- when kevin says the rock was &quot;hugging him&quot; and later on he drops it, gets caught and injured with it = everything the working class cling onto will be taken from them<br>- the parks are not aware they have a basement makes the maid and her husband living in it even more symbolic; rich are not aware of the working class&#39; hardships and cover it up (like how the shelves cover the basement)<br>- their smell that they can&#39;t get rid of = inescapable poverty<br>- mr and mrs park engaging in sexual behaviour and being loud but the kims sleeping peacefully underneath = hints at their working class issues, sleeping with noise so they got used to it but mr park isn’t used to their &#39;boiled rag&#39; scent he complained about earlier<br>- the kims’ house floods right after mr kim reassures their children and tells them to have a bath = they don’t always have a stable place to go to whereas when mr and mrs park woke up from their son sleeping outside and told him to sleep inside, they don’t need to worry about it<br>- little bit of rain was a struggle for their son in a tent outside but an entire flood happened in the kims’ family = working class struggles will always be worse than upper class struggles<br>- all the blood on white material imagery persistent in the film; sauce mr kim splattered on the tissue the maid used to show that she had TB and then the real blood splattered across the white coloured food at da-song&#39;s birthday party from the maid&#39;s husband slashing people. he also had blood and white frosting on his face from jessica cake smashing him. perhaps hints at the purity (white aspect) the upper class get to enjoy and the death and horror (red aspect) the working class have to endure<br>- light in the parks&#39; house keeps blinking (mr kim doing morse code) even after maid’s husband died = working class issues will continue to live on unless things change",ecstasy,2021-01-24T01:01:04Z,2357

"@Tretch i understand where you&#39;re coming from, of course creators might not always intend for a certain meaning but in my opinion that&#39;s the beauty of art; all the interpretations EVERYONE can make from it, not just exclusive and limited to only the creator&#39;s intentions",ecstasy,2021-05-07T07:15:55Z,7
"@ecstasy you’re right, which is why direct metaphors in art are pointless. It’s kinda the age old struggle in art, artists sometimes make something just because it’s aesthetic or serves some type of narrative purpose, and then you have a bunch of English teachers and YouTube commenters deciphering some special meaning in it. As you said, there’s no wrong interpretation, and any scene can be contextualized to serve some type of special meaning, when in reality there’s a good chance the creators never even intended it to be that way.",Tretch,2021-05-07T06:57:45Z,1

"I agree this movie should terrify us because of the reactions like this video to it. There&#39;s always capitalism vs socialism argument going on without understanding the root causes.  In a nutshell, ANY system that rewards productive agents while providing open access (i.e. equal opportunity) will prevail. It&#39;s not about how &quot;hard&quot; one works, a janitor can work as hard as Steve Jobs yet society will value their work differently. <br><br>The one that creates more value will be rewarded with more resources. This is something EVERYONE misses.  Socialism by definition, although good in intention, does a really poor job at rewarding those that produce value. In fact it does the opposite by removing rewards. <br><br>Government&#39;s role should be to make sure there is equal opportunities, not like it is now where they just print money and debase the currency at like 2% per year and cause inflation, yes, inflation is only caused one way, by printing. Just look at bitcoin, the value goes up because supply of coins are limited so you have to keep dividing the money. Imagine if government could not print money, you&#39;d have money increasing in value.  But no, you have the poor being hit the hardest by inflation because politicians love to spend money, forever keeping the poor, poor.",ishudshutup,2021-01-04T09:10:09Z,3

Cultural hegemony is also showed by associating wealth with America. The Kim children’ names become Americanised when they are playing the role of university student that tutors Park’s daughter and an artist that teaches Park’s young son. In the poster of Mr. Park’s success we also see him with the name Nathan. This division between west and the rest in this case South Korea is also seen with the Park’s obsession with everything foreign like when their son goes to sleep in the tent outside and mr. Park worries about it only to a get a reply from his wife that she bought the tent from America so nothing can happen to it. <br>Thank you for your great analysis of this brilliant movie!,Ines Raycheva,2020-12-20T00:15:07Z,78

"I am so glad we don&#39;t allow dubbing in the US, and we explore the language of the director and the actors actual performance. I have lived in France for 5 years and they dub all foreign film. I feel like the US figured out how stupid it looked when they tried doing it with kung fu films. Why the French think it looks fine, I don&#39;t know lack of attention to detail. I feel like they have wine and we have film as our export. Also so many French people love American actors but have never heard their actual voices, that is weird to me. It&#39;s art erasure, you can&#39;t say you saw an Oscar winning performance dubbed, I&#39;m sorry, but nope. The theaters show like 70% dubbed and 30% subtitled/original language, but if it&#39;s airing on TV you will be hard pressed to find the original language, and if you are new to the language they won&#39;t even have subtitles in French to try and check what you think you heard. I was asking my husband, so how do deaf people watch TV, that seems unfair in that sense as well. I will say I do understand dubbing movies for kids, for obvious reasons. The other horrible thing dubbing does is make French people think they own things they don&#39;t, like movies or tv series. For example I&#39;ve had colleagues tell me about shows they think are French, and I&#39;ll be like nope it&#39;s not, how did you not see the hilarious corny dubbing?",Niqalia Evans,2020-12-17T16:24:03Z,0
"One of my favorite details of the movie is that the house, which is pretty overtly a metaphor for the class system itself, is repeatedly said to have been made by the previous owner, the architect Namgoong.

"Good points but the idea that the family is hard working but only for social/economic constructs they are poor is a bit one sided. They are lazy, they cut corners they don&#39;t do a good job folding the pizza boxes. When they do manage to put their efforts into conning their way in they&#39;re undone not by some construct but because they sit around being drunk. You could say they&#39;re taught to only want to be drunk and hurl hammer throws into the neighbourhood dissolving anyone of personal responsibility but deeper I think it&#39;s Scorpion and toad. He knows they don&#39;t fit in not because of just money, having good jobs didn&#39;t change them.

Can you analyze &quot;the circle of power&quot; using the same data? Lets put these intuition into communism and see how fair it is compared to capitalism. Of course capitalism is not fair game but many people living in capitalism are able to start their own business and perceive a fair amount of wealth and freedom.,Carlos Lucena,2020-11-24T21:48:05Z,2

"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgAK-4kPTb8&amp;t=9m48s"">9:48</a> newsflash, and I&#39;m sure I&#39;m going to totally blow the mind of this late capitalistic American who created this video, but democracy is not American. Comparing a democracy index to skin whitening is the most tone deaf thing that honestly only someone raised like the Parks would do. What exactly is wrong to use the &quot;western&quot; democracy as the base of an index? What a horrible standard democracy is, right?

"Practically speaking, I think she’s the one who has the most flexibility as a con artist. She’s not just young, but also has a kind of inner confidence and elegance that would make her suit a lot of high-paying professions. If she didn’t die, maybe she could con her way into wealth someday. (Not that it wouldn’t still be a sad thing for her. She’s actually very intelligent and talented.

"Another lesson that can be drawn out of this is how easily the &quot;rags-to-riches&quot; individuals tend to forget their roots or where they started from. The Kims, once they are secured in their jobs and view themselves as moving up the wealth ladder, act the part of the rich. They dismiss the former cook&#39;s pleas to help her and her husband, despite the fact that they are similar. But another aspect that drew me to this conclusion was their initial dismissal of the rain.<br> Where I live, whenever it rains, my first thought is of flooding, because my home tends to get flooded no matter how light or heavy the rain is. When the Kims are sitting in the Park&#39;s living room overlooking the window to the thunder and rain, the father remarks how wonderful the sight is. Their first thought wasn&#39;t of their basement-dwelling, and the worry of the potential of the floodwaters flooding their room, which was very much likely to happen given their home location. No, they were too busy contemplating their success and drinking to give a momentarily thought to who they are and where they came from. This happens quite often to wealthy people who came from poor backgrounds. The need to assimilate into the &quot;rich persona&quot; subsumes their old identity, until it is eventually expunged from the new persona they have adapted to because now, it has no place. As a result, they suffer the consequences of adopting a false identity in order to fit into a social class.",Edwina Aryeetey,2020-11-16T13:56:24Z,5335

And you like those ideas, because you don&#39;t have to move a finger to feel as heroes, <br><br>or go to a couple of demonstrations, when you could do so much with what you have if you were not so envious and voraciously consuming<br><br> (because you can&#39;t live with little while you make, it, you need to comply to your nonsensical consumerist friends).<br><br>It will be fun to see if you ever wake up, or start a dumb revolution to go back to the same place and then realize the problem was you all along. <br><br>USA, Korea and such, will be a nice show for the next decades (if you don&#39;t play with nuclear weapons in between), because you sure as hell will not renounce to your victim-role, it is too sweet. <br><br>There will always be a conspiracy in which you are being profited unfairly by the evil rich.

Is the death of, for example, a highly skilled person who contributed a lot to society throughout their life by excelling in whichever field they chose  same as the death of a person who lived a life not worth remembering? It is kind of intriguing. Death does equalize everyone, but one thing that can never be equalized is other people&#39;s memory of you. In Hinduism it is believed that whatever happens after your death is a direct result of your karma in your life. So basically, you could have died as a good person who gave joy and love to others while you were alive, or you could have died as a bad person, who gave pain and caused the suffering of others, or anything in between or apart from these two extremes.

"I wanted to point this out because capitalism has become such a buzzword lately: class is not an invention or by-product of capitalism. The video talks a lot about capitalism and the lack of social mobility which is not true- there WAS no social mobility with feudalism, the system that existed before capitalism. You were born poor, you died poor (hence fairy-tales like Cinderella touching on social mobility; the dream that a poor girl could aspire to be a queen). There IS social mobility under capitalism, it&#39;s just not moral, hence apple getting rich off the backs of the poor. They got rich, so there is social mobility, but from immoral means. How many times do we hear of people that were well-off suddenly becoming homeless? That&#39;s social mobility; they dropped below.

"i think you were able to point out the key messages of the movie, but to link that to the fault of free market capitalism is too far of a stretch. <br><br>Even america is not a free market capitalism (i&#39;m using america because the referred to apple and mostly companies of the us) , the monopolies or in this video you used, the ruling class, are create by the intervention of the government through making policies that favours big companies. I will take the example of skin, sunscreen in particular, american consumers can&#39;t get EASY access to other countries&#39; better cheaper products because of FDA&#39;s regulations, it disguises itself as protecting consumers, but it actually limited competition, hence create monopolies. I would suggest you the works of Milton Friedman, Friedrick Hayek, their colleages, and deeper dive into economic history. I&#39;m concerned with your opinion on free market capitalism and more government intervention. Government interventions are creating more class differences, simply count the number of rules in your country in the last 50 years, is it increasing, decreasing? And how did that affect the class differences?<br><br>I do agree with your opinion on corporates need to be more responsible, but instead of putting more red bans on anything, leaving on big companies are able to survive and work around those red bans. As a used to be labor and currently small business owner, I experience by myself what more red bans mean and affect business. <br><br>The whitening skin culture is &quot;no way that this can be divorced from a long history of colonialism&quot;, it&#39;s an opinion and western colonialism is not that long. :)) I think others have voiced their opinion about this, i think that&#39;s enough.

The first time I saw a white person, I perceived them to be ill. We don&#39;t perceive you as white - or when we say &quot;white&quot; we are not referencing European skin color. We consider ourselves white. The desire for light skin over dark skin is a beauty standard in a lot of asian cultures that long pre-dates the modern age. For example, in Central Asia, blue eyes and blonde hair (some of us are born with) were traditionally seen as undesirable. Of course, times have changed but it illustrates that we are not dying to look like Europeans and the &quot;obsession&quot; with white skin is not rooted in admiration of european concepts of beauty.

"You mention Apple as a prime example of “cool capitalism” but we always tend to frame our country as the problem. This country is built off a free market economy where other countries like China (thus the outsourcing) are socialist. We need to be more aware of who we hold accountable, because this country will never allow such brazen labor policies the way that communist China does. I write this because I understand that this video is a socialist promotion. Socialism doesn’t fix the wage gap. it actually creates an even larger gap between the elite (government) and the people. Look at the Hunger Games for example. The hunger games is a prime example of socializing and nationalizing all resources for the distribution of others.

The Best Parasite review ever,May 10,2020-09-27T11:18:59Z,0
"Parasite is the most thoughtful film to have won an Academy Award since who knows when... And you hit the meaning right on the head. As Sleepytime Gorilla Museum state so well in the poetry of The Creature, a parasite cannot live if it kills its host. And the most successful parasites are the ones that the host is unaware of. So the real parasites today basically keep the people they are leeching from barely alive, but not so close to death that the victim will become aware of what is happening to them.<br>If John Maynard Keynes could have seen what capitalism would bring to today&#39;s generation, he would have never shared the economic theories that came to be named after him. Without Keynes, capitalism would have died decades ago.",Dean Just Dean,2020-09-27T11:00:35Z,0

"Lmao I thought the ad for the skin whitening soap you put in was an actual ad since i&#39;m from the Philippines. It actually hits hard considering my country&#39;s still extremely affected by &quot;white is always better&quot; to the point where it&#39;s a regular topic of conversation among people. It&#39;s extremely common to hear remarks like &quot;Oh ew you got darker&quot;, or &quot; I look better now that i lhave skin like *insert pale celebrity name here*&quot; in everyday discussions. Hell, even our indigenous tribes are defined by their darker skin and are currently at the brunt of extreme social and racial discrimination here whenever they choose to try and make a livelihood in big cities. It was completely disheartening whenever my girlfriend would almost always become really insecure about her darker skin and asked me too many times if she looked beautiful with her complexion when she&#39;s the most beautiful person to me. But how can she not, when whenever you turn a corner you see a poster or billboard for skin whitening soap and when she opens her phone she sees more ads for them. And it makes me sick how a lot of those who reek of privilege here who can afford quality education sit in their classes and pretend to give a damn about their history class about the culture and tradition of our indigenous ancestors; the same people who they right now look upon with disgust and prejudice. Great video! Might have to rewatch the movie since I watched it on my phone which probably made me miss a lot of details.",nja,2020-09-23T03:36:09Z,746

A number of democratic, capitalist countries present people with the conditions to become rich. Even communist (but really capitalist) China has tons of self-made rich people. It&#39;s just that the vast majority of people don&#39;t have the talent and drive and sometimes ruthlessness needed to rise to the top. That doesn&#39;t make us &quot;losers&quot; in my opinion.

It kinda shocked me when i saw comments like that because I thought it was clear as day that that scene was, in a way, &quot;ridiculing&quot; Ki-woo&#39;s aspiration and even BJH said that it would prob take Ki-woo 500 over years to be able to afford a house like that...

The poor are &#39;surviving&#39; off the rich while the rich are &#39;living&#39; off the poor. <br>The middle class are busy making resumes .😐,Mr Together,2020-09-09T13:01:16Z,15070
"@David Bodor there IS such a thing as ‘middle class’. Marx had a different name for them — ‘petty bourgeoisie’.<br><br>The petty bourgeoisie, or ‘middle class’, are people who own enough means of production to largely supplement their income, but not so much that they don’t need some form of employment. They often work skilled jobs or in their own small businesses, but are independently wealthy enough to not be destitute if they don’t have wages. Eg. The ‘middle class’ can afford to attend university for a couple of years (at the cost of not earning a salary) to get qualified for high paying jobs, while the workers will always be stuck in their place.<br><br>The reason why Marx boiled it down to two basic classes (owners and workers) was to sensationalise the problem. It’s like clickbait to get people interested enough to realise that they’re basically being exploited.<br><br>If you don’t believe this, I’ll tell you a story. My family is ‘middle class’, we own some means of production through investments (about $2M all up). This is enough money for us to own our own home. It’s enough to enjoy a significantly higher standard of living than proletarians… but it’s not enough to sustainably keep our standard of living for more than 5 years. We work high paying jobs close to the top and invest our earnings, but we aren’t part of the top. We have proximity to the capitalist class and enjoy some of its benefits, but we aren’t fully part of it ourselves. It’s these people who are neither completely dependent on work but don’t own enough to mooch off the system who are ‘middle class’.",tacos mexicanstyle,2021-09-21T17:29:19Z,0

"@Juliano   idr exactly what I said but yes I’d consider to have this levels homelessness , working class(only enough for necessities  ,upper working class (has at least a little extra )  , middle class (has a house or can cover rent no problem ,  maybe a car  ) upper middle class would be having a house or not worry about expense of rent (can easily pay it,) , a car and can live comfortably . Then there’s upper class . I don’t think we’re having any type of animosity but actually stating facts. I’m lower working-class practically on the poverty line ; I can&#39;t afford my 300$ asthma medication and buy the emergency one to use daily which we shouldn&#39;t use but that&#39;s all I can afford, I’m only a little in debt cuz I wanted to do school and did a 6month course which is a little cheaper and quicker ; I still haven&#39;t  gotten a job from that and have been working just retail /restaurant jobs and atm they only pay 7-10 an hour and only give u at most 25 hours a week at least 16. I tried to pay my school as I went, but work didn’t work cuz it was not enough for bear necessities and had to get a losn (that&#39;s why in debt )  with it n iv had 3 different jobs since I started school and only this year. I live in a cheap apt w a cockroach infestation, I have it clean but they r still there.  So it&#39;s not holding animosity, it&#39;s just actual lived in experience  n even if u do try so so hard it is very difficultif u have always been lower working class",Strawberry Angelic,2021-09-05T11:20:22Z,0

"hi, I love the subversiveness of this video - I thumbed up.  Now the question is who is being subversive and what is being subverted in my statement?  Am I the subverted?  haha, just kidding.  But as a would-be writer and film maker (I&#39;m making all this up) I always wanted to know why the daughter was killed and now I see it.  I don&#39;t come from rich and powerful therefore I would be blind to the brainwashing because the brainwashed do not know they are brainwashed except that I understood this video or parts of it such that the cultural hegemony might have had cracks and partially flaked off.  Where is the danger and where is the fear?  Who should be terrified, I wonder.  The best solution is just like what Bong and cast did, which was to walk through the metaphorical streets of Hollywood (not literally) and come out unscathed and unchanged, perhaps unimpressed.

I actually interpreted the name differently <br>I thought the name parasite is a personification of that strange stone kinda thing the Kim family had they thought their life could get better cuz it’s “good luck”. That hope was a parasite. That hope made them go out of their way and overlook consequences<br><br>Edit : For Park’s family the parasite might be their gullible nature. Which ends them in loss?

"I don&#39;t understand the relationship of why Americans have to be held liable for the living conditions and social inequalities of those countries. Their government is the one allowing such cheap labor. I&#39;m pretty sure Americans would pay more money for an iPhone if it required a higher wage for the manufacturer workers. It seems the narrative here is that the US is to be held responsible of cheap labor in foreign countries. Even if the US was responsible, we would never be able to change the labor problem on that country. So, the alternate solution would be for Apple to cut ties with Foxconn, wouldn&#39;t that be also problematic for that region? Wouldn&#39;t we do far worse to that economy if we pull the plug?  We can&#39;t hold Foxconn at gun point and demand them to pay higher wages, and I highly doubt that Apple would be able to enforce such thing either... This is why I don&#39;t understand your whole narrative. You want to make a comparison that in my opinion, does not fit with the issue the movie is trying to portray.",CmlDexter,2020-09-03T00:41:03Z,0

The movie was really a roller coaster for me. <br><br>On the topic of skin lightening, I know a lot of people have brought up the historical basis in the East in wanting to emulate lighter skin to give off the illusion of affluence. I agree and disagree with this. I think that while that history has helped formulate this way of thinking, we can&#39;t just assume the world exists in a vacuum.  <br><br>Our world is rapidly globalizing (is already globalized) in large part to the internet but also to the long-armed colonization efforts of European countries past. It is much more likely nowadays that while people may have started lightening their skin to appear richer, it&#39;s also a behavioral trend that has been enforced and perpetuated by pervasive eurocentric media.

As you can see from the oppression going on in the country right now but whatever. Also secondary the rich and poor groups are constantly moving and poor now is not like poor back then. Poor now even not including things that weren&#39;t around a hundred years ago okay let&#39;s say a cars for example fridge TV we discluded all of those and just made it about day-to-day life day today like specifically speaking is easier now than it was back then I know that sounds fake or like I&#39;m making it up but it&#39;s absolutely true now is it true in New York Chicago I will tell Iowa of the worst states to live. All of these states like New York California and no stuff that&#39;s so expensive to live in and don&#39;t have anything to offer back and California New York Illinois are almost consoling the top worst state why is that most liberal areas Wisconsin is also one of the worst state Michigan another one of one of the worst state sometimes they do better in certain things like sometimes I think taxes are lower sometimes in certain County but know they&#39;re all terrible Blastoise run places are bad there&#39;s a reason for that they&#39;re all f*<b>****, I need sorry but it&#39;s true they all have their stuff based in what she is saying if you believe in that s**</b> you&#39;re an idiot and you don&#39;t know a damn thing about history and you&#39;ve never worked like actual work on talking labor not you know some cushy job you got cuz he got to go to college because Mommy and Daddy paid your way your whole f*<b>***</b> life no I&#39;m talking about poor you&#39;ve never really been for none of you have or you wouldn&#39;t want this I&#39;ve been poor on and off my whole life we don&#39;t want this I&#39;m telling you from personal experience trust me when I say you don&#39;t want that kind of poor I&#39;ve only been that kind of poor once and it was when I was in Mexico and stuck there dressed me you don&#39;t want it I promise you this before Mexico was doing better this was back in the 90s when it was way worse than it is now. There were certain areas that were better but trust me where I was in central Mexico that&#39;s real poor real poor and guess what lots of people who don&#39;t like white looking girls I&#39;m not white but I look like so unfortunately I don&#39;t have to tell that to people a lot. Anywhere, also it&#39;s funny that she says all this but it why is it that Republicans give more and practice and charity in real life when Democrats do why is that has anybody asked themselves. Poor and Rich alike it doesn&#39;t matter across-the-board Republicans give more I think there&#39;s a reason for that and maybe a reason you should look into learn a little something educate yourself for fun instead of listening to the mainstream media and idiots like this dumb b*<b>*</b> cuz you don&#39;t want what she is offering you by the way Korea I love Korea don&#39;t get me wrong I have absolutely door Korea South Korea obviously not North but the thing is they have a lot of class issues that stem from back when they weren&#39;t free and it has nothing to do with capitalism it has to do with the same b*<b>****</b> the English had for like 500 f*<b>***</b> years they still have it to some degree have you ever seen Parliament what happens there is four voting is concerned I mean who gets voted in who gets chosen it&#39;s almost all people who are distant relatives or relatives of somebody and so who&#39;s you know an English great family. I&#39;m not kidding all of them Barnett&#39;s ladies all of those people or Kings or Queens all of those people vote for those people I mean not the not the rich people I&#39;m talking about England as a whole typically votes for these elitist families and I&#39;m not saying elitist like they&#39;re snobs I mean it as they are the Elite families. Sometimes elitism is just as simple as being a Elite. anyway there&#39;s a reason for that it&#39;s because they have classism the reason why the US works is because classism is it a real thing here okay let me give an example would anyone bat an eye if anyone from the US who&#39;s rich stopped and sat down and talked to a homeless person I&#39;m talking about anybody famous person you&#39;d probably be like all that&#39;s really nice maybe take a picture and then you go about your day and the only reason why you took pictures cuz he saw famous person let&#39;s be honest but if you saw Donald Trump before he was Donald Trump you know what I mean like as just a billionaire would you really go what are you doing in that $7,000 coat sitting down with the homeless man. No no one would think that because they know that it&#39;s not a big deal to be helping someone people help people as proven during 9/11 we didn&#39;t give a fuk who what it could have been a poor homeless dude we&#39;re going to run in and save them no matter how stinky they might be.

But you addressed this in the video, they were fighting to be better and to see who can be the least poor. It even happens in our own society.

As individuals, we are all out for ourselves and our immediate friends or family members and that’s pretty much it. Nobody, rich or poor, cares about the welfare of total strangers.<br><br>Capitalism, will inevitably leave some people out in the cold as not everyone can be rich, but everyone at least gets a chance to improve their situations. With a society that requires an authoritarian government to make it work or where an authoritarian government otherwise exists, the people who become wealthy and powerful are the politically connected. Everyone else is left out in the cold with no chance to improve their situation.

"Great work. I would like to comment on a misconception often held by those in the west. The desire for lighter skin (in Asia — EXCLUDING INDIA, idk about anywhere else) has nothing to do with Eurocentric ideals of beauty. It is a classist and historical issue where centuries of economic disparity has physically manifested in the skin color of an otherwise homogeneous society. Rich people had light skin because they were indoors and didn&#39;t work outside. Poor people had darker skin because lower wage jobs mandated outdoor work. So to be clear: <br><br>People in Asia want to have white skin, not to look like a white person, but to look rich.

"@Ash Yes, I think I&#39;ve watched it enough times. I know fair enough that there were a lot of parallels shown between the families&#39; lifestyle as well as how hypocritical both of them are. I just see in real life that you don&#39;t need to be part of the upper society to show you&#39;re a hypocrite, lack morals or treat others with disrespect because you have a better status than them, or that you pay them. Like I said in my other reply, I was just genuinely surprised her feet was also pointed out, since it was pretty much normal for me considering what I&#39;ve seen and experienced.

I lie down all the time and put my feet on the window,  because I just wanna rest after a long day. I&#39;m in the comforts of my own car, and I think even I would put down my feet if it smelled. I&#39;m in the own comforts of my own car, I pay the driver to drive and no I don&#39;t look down on them. But why would you hire a driver in the first place when you can&#39;t even relax in your own car because it&#39;s going to be considered rude. Also, she put her feet above the empty chair, which still gave even a bit of proximity rather than place her feet on the side handle between the two front seats. I don&#39;t mean to start a fight or be rude, I was just genuinely surprised that there&#39;s a comment about her feet. Where I&#39;m from, it depends on who you&#39;re with.

This ending also opens the door to a sequel of how does his son ( and mother) go about making the fortune to buy the house and ultimately live out that last scene of walking into their now owned house and allowing their father to come upstairs and live a new life not in the  lower socio-economical status they were so use to.

"The problem with the sentiment that people pull away from movies like this isn&#39;t that there isn&#39;t truth to be found in it regarding the flaws that can be found in capitalism, but that it tends to convince people to reject the system outright, and swing them into the opposite end of the spectrum, i.e. into the Marxist and communist camp which hold their own issues and severe capabilities for oppression. On the one hand, capitalism, most often thought of in the laissez faire sense, can grow to the extent to which an entity&#39;s influence is simply too large to be ignored, and that it becomes capable of gaming the system to itself, such as buying influence in government, or shutting down competitiveness in the market needed to sustain more positive aspects of the capitalism. People who claim to be enormous supporters of the free market on the surface, but will accept government bailouts at the expense of the taxpayer when an economic downturn emerges, are extremely hypocritical. No one should be allowed to steal wood from someone else&#39;s ship when theirs is sinking. Whatever reasons they may put forward to legitimate these actions, and whether one agrees or disagrees with the pros and cons of them in any given circumstance, many of the practices currently endorsed by so-called proponents of capitalism are inherently at odds with some of its foundational values, and seem to rarely be criticized by those invested in that system (however I should say this does not mean there aren&#39;t honest people who do.) <br>Speaking from a US perspective, in some ways, the current capitalism we have can be seen as a bastardization of it. In other ways, and sometimes by the same token, we can see the unethical tendencies that come part and parcel with it when allowed to exacerbate unchecked. While there are flaws, it cannot be said that capitalism hasn&#39;t contributed immensely to the progress of humanity as a whole, so in that, it&#39;s quite risky to throw the baby out with the bathwater in deciding whether it is simply good or not. The capitalist system is in a significant way directly tied to the notion of individual liberty. However, when powerful enough entities establish themselves by way of it, they can act increasingly unethical without taking on the rightly deserved accountability and consequences for it. Inferring from this, I believe the most responsible course of action ought to be to retain capitalism is some respect, but that the extent of it&#39;s corruptible nature should be curtailed by strictly enforced ethical principles. Compromise is very important, so while I agree with the right to free enterprise, it doesn&#39;t mean that I agree people/corporations should be allowed to use their stature for unabashed favoritism or objectively unethical behavior. If we don&#39;t begin articulating and implementing what these principles should be, corruption is simply inevitable. <br>Corruption is what a lot of these issues boil down to, and they are just as threatening under collectivist systems are they are capitalist ones.<br>In terms of the more collectivist ideologies, the promises made by these systems can be easily accepted on their surface and theory. The inherent perceived virtuousness of their common messages makes them all the more palpable to the public. However, though with different causes, the natural tendency of the direction these ideologies take produces many of the same issues as unchecked free market capitalism does, and not uncommonly worse. While I don&#39;t want to speak for everyone, and there are differing opinions on the extent to which these ideologies should influence the lives of citizens overall, for the sake of conciseness, I&#39;ll be more or less referring to communism, since many collectivist proponents tend to accept that it is the end stage of what they view as the natural progression of viable economic systems.",E Jakobs,2020-07-21T08:04:10Z,0

"When we think about corruption, we tend to think about outside forces worming their way into the government to disrupt what their priorities should be, usually through money, bribery, things we associate with capitalism.<br>When we think about tyranny, we think about government that has grown big enough and strong enough to overstep its boundaries and infringe on our civil and human rights, which is how many people view communism and other totalitarian regimes.<br>However, it&#39;s not immediately clear why our perception is so when we compare these two things. They are both situations we would call out as corruption, but what is the difference, and what are the implications of those differences? I think that the answer sounds something like this:<br>Corruption in government in a capitalist society fundamentally stems from the fact that we overtly allow the influence of money in government. We have lobbyists, we have politicians that get paid absurd sums of money from entities simply for giving a speech, and we have this tacit notion that money is speech. While this is last part is actually true, the current rules do not result in a fair representation of the public. Some can give more, some can give less. Rather than what we currently have, in addition to stricter bribery laws, we ought to enact legislation that says everyone is only allotted and allowed $1000 dollars to donate however they&#39;d like. Exceeding this would be unlawful and punishable. The issue with corruption of government in capitalist nations is a fixable issue if we can pass the right legislation to combat it. Government is a public service, not a business. The fact that you can come into it an average citizen and walk out a millionaire is a major symptom of that problem. If we get money out of politics, the people whom were involved for which would begin to weed out, and those who are legitimately interested in civil service would would begin finding their way in, as well as becoming freer to work for the public good without corporate interests obstructing their progress. In this scenario, we can get rid of the corruption, and power is retained in the hands of the people both by the democratic system and their financial support.<br>However, we now imagine a communist system, one in which an overarching governmental body innately controls all of the nations resources and decides how to distribute those resources to the people in a fair fashion. In this system, the individual does not have a the same bargaining chip for their voice or opinion. The government already controls the resources, and they&#39;re the ones who make the laws. In this system, without private property and ownership of what you independently produce, the government has the innate right to come to you to take what they say is theirs. Of course, in the pretext of doing so, the government will always insist that it is for &quot;the good of everyone and the country.&quot; But imagine if it wasn&#39;t. Imagine if this government controls the nation in it&#39;s totality, all the way down to the individual citizen and what they produce. If the government is corrupt, they take more for themselves or play favorites with the tribute they take from the hands of the worker, and there is absolutely no recourse for the citizen. The government already has all the land, production, makes all the laws, as well as controls the police and military. It can physically enforce it&#39;s &quot;right&quot; to take that tribute from you. Communism is always sold to the public as people collectively owning the land, but it is still big government by any other name. Worse than that, since communist regimes have reliably rejected the individual liberty to bear arms, they are utterly at the mercy of the totalitarian state. Now the state is not only the one with the nations resources, property, and laws in it&#39;s grip, it is the only one with guns. Notwithstanding scenarios of basic personal protection from other vagrant citizens, this situation alone should definitely concern people. If the government were ever to become irredeemably corrupt, the people are simply incapable of ever physically taking that power back. This isn&#39;t to say it couldn&#39;t happen through a long arduous process of infiltration and persuasion of the powers, but history has shown us that the corrupt faction uses every tool at its disposal to prevent that from happening (propaganda, internet censorship, politcal prison, intimidation, coercion, erasure of right to protest, erasure of free speech to criticize, erasure of basic human liberties.) As we see in communist china, the people are living under the ever-present thumb of the government. They have some of the most oppressive, coercive, and fear-inciting intimidation tactics in the modern world. It is a place of thought police and speech police. A place where mere accusation is enough to have you pursued and silenced. A place where they can put you in a chastity cage on live TV to shame you, and make you apologize for criticizing the government in a facebook post. It is a place where if they cannot get to you, they will go after your family. A place where totalitarian control by the state forces you to filter your thoughts, words, and actions to conform to them. A place where your destiny is not your own. <br>In an ideal world, we would be able to trust the government in managing the totality of power and resource control that we turn over to them, but realistically, the powerful people in government are human like anyone else. They play favorites, want to protect their own interests and power, and will oppress the masses in order to retain these things and the system that supports it. When people vote for communism, they have never received what they thought they were going to get. Many people will criticize capitalistic society as a plutocracy, or worry about the emergence of one. The benefit to a capitalist free nation like the United States is that we can enact laws to prevent this from happening. It is indeed feasible to create a system where people can enjoy the right to free enterprise without allowing that enterprise to get out of control, provided we elect the right leaders and pass the right laws. However, by voting for a communist regime to take power, you are inherently voting for a plutocracy. Collectivist systems like communism are idealistic, and assume that no matter how many attempts at this have resulted in extreme suffering, oppression, or abject failure, one day someone will do it right. This is not a an optimistic endeavor to pursue. Whether it&#39;s the history of 100 million deaths, or the fact that people are still risking their lives to escape it today, we must take the idea of implementing it into any part of the world with great caution. <br>For all of it&#39;s history and flaws, capitalism has comparably fared much better overall in improving the lives of citizens under it. It is a system that mimics the natural world. A system that acknowledges that while not all things can be equal in every sphere, equality cannot simply be artificially imposed on the world. Capitalism has been and still is the most reliable and efficient mode of innovation, of raising the overall standard of living for all people, and remains the economic system that provides the greatest amount of liberty to every individual citizen. It cannot be stressed enough, that the radical collectivist systems of the world seem to be fundamentally at odds with the notions of individual, inalienable rights and liberty we take for granted in the US. It&#39;s important to remember that communism is not just an economic system, but a political one primarily, and politics is the game bureaucrats play to test to what extent they can dictate your life.<br>It can be confusing to parse, sometimes, but when we look back at the US, it is a crucial difference that the people control the economy, not the government. While government can make rules and regulations about business practices, they cannot take that business away from you. The notion of free enterprise is inherently power in the hands of the people. It is not something we should be willing to give up, because if we change our minds, who knows how many years, decades, or lives it might cost to get it back. Communism always starts as some form of grassroots &quot;people&#39;s movement,&quot; but overtime inevitably grows to the oppressive hierarchical power structure they didn&#39;t want. Remember this, and also remember to be inherently distrustful of all big government. At the end of the day, big government is always interested in trying to control something, so be wary of what it is they&#39;re seeking to control. Lastly, be very careful what your asking for of it, because you might not always like what you get in the end.",E Jakobs,2020-07-21T08:04:17Z,0

Fuck outta here with this narrative that &quot;Rich people are parasites because they exploit laborers&quot;. They do no such thing. They pay them &quot;fair&quot; value based on equilibrium market prices. Anyone with two arms and half a brain can build an iPhone (Which is becoming more and more automated every year anyway). When there&#39;s hundreds of millions of people worldwide with no other marketable skills than those pertaining to doing menial labor then of course their compensation is going to be very little. It&#39;s just the way the market works. The Park family did absolutely nothing wrong throughout the movie. They did&#39;t leach off anyone. Mr. Park built a highly successful technology company. Hence why he can afford the nice house. He had a valuable idea and made a valuable contribution to society. Mr. Kim has been through dozens of failed ventures. He just doesn&#39;t have what it takes. Hence why he is poor. That&#39;s not wrong. That&#39;s just how life works. The poor in this movie are very much the eponymous &quot;parasites&quot;. The rich people are their victims.,MoMoneyLessProblems,2020-07-04T18:54:45Z,0
"Parasite was a hard film to stomach. Often times I definitely think that middle class and lower class communities are allied in a sense against the rich and the oppressive capitalist systems. But Parasite tells the truth that a lot of us middle class and lower class folks don&#39;t want to admit. That we often times admire or even worship the wealthy, in hopes that we can get a taste of the life they get to live. We would rather fight each other for scraps and attempt to &quot;eliminate our competition&quot; than unite and try to find a way to dismantle the system and people that put us against one another in the first place. <br><br>The Kim family didn&#39;t stop to think about the jobs they were stealing and the lives they were ruining by taking them. The original housekeeper had safety in the Park home, away from loan sharks and access to her husband to keep him fed and to check on him. Then she was kicked out from her safe haven, couldn&#39;t even tell her husband what happened probably. Mrs. Kim looks down on the housekeeper, accepting the role she has as an upper class housekeeper over the jobless, beaten and desperate lower class former housekeeper. She cannot empathize with her anymore. Even though promising to feed her husband would be such an easy and harmless thing to do, she refuses. The conflict could have been mostly avoided had she not forgotten where she comes from and empathized with the woman and agreed to help her out in such a small way. <br><br>Everybody in Parasite is a parasite and a host simultaneously. The poor are hosts to the rich parasites, being used for their mostly cheap labor, doing unfulfilling and draining tasks for low wages, just trying to survive themselves. The poor are parasites to the rich hosts by manipulating them and using them to hopefully advance their social and economic class further up. They didn&#39;t care what happened to the people they got fired. They didn&#39;t care about the Park family as people, except for maybe Da-Hye who while blissfully was able to enjoy her privilege of wealth, didn&#39;t actively think badly of the poor and even despite Kevin and  his family smelling like &quot;poor&quot; she still found him attractive.<br><br> She became a victim by having her seemingly normal boyfriend being bludgeoned and having to carry him to safety, learning later on that the driver killed her father, the driver who is her boyfriend&#39;s father, how her boyfriend&#39;s entire family was using her family and that her boyfriend was never really who he said he was, she fell in love with a person that he was not, a person who is later just outed as a scammer along with his mother, permanently living with brain damage. The reason parasite was so good, I believe, is because it wasn&#39;t the straight forward &quot;rich people bad&quot; commentary a lot of us expected. It was commentary on capitalist society as a whole, and how even the good intentioned or those who are taking an opportunity for a better life are not all innocent. How we all have blood on our hands. <br><br>Watching the Kim family and the housekeeper and her husband fight like animals was one of the harder scenes to watch. How one poor family threatened the other poor family with exposing them for who they truly are in hopes to tear them down the same way they tore them down or maybe even in hopes of getting her job back. How one poor family murdered &quot;one of them&quot; just to keep up with their facade for not even much longer. Only when the Kim family loses everything they had going for them, do they gain some sort of empathy and human-ness back. There seems to be lots of regret, lots of remorse. Losing a daughter, losing a sister but not being able to truly grieve because you have brain damage, losing the chance of normalcy you got only a taste of because you became the very thing you hated or envied, greedy parasites.",GGKittyXO,2020-07-04T15:03:45Z,641

"The richest man in the world Jeff Bezos is rich BECAUSE of the millions of workers he&#39;s paying barely enough to live. If he paid them all what they deserved he would still more rich than he needs to be.

And people still say that rich corporations don&#39;t deserve to be taxed more and minimum wage shouldn&#39;t be increased. A family with 3 kids needs to have both parents working in order to provide for them all which means that both parents are being forced to abandon their kid for 8 hours a day every weekday, it&#39;s no wonder that kids grow up depressed.

"I disagree with people saying &quot;everyone is a parasite&quot; and &quot;everyone is morally ambiguous.&quot; The poor family used manipulation and forgery and murder. There is nothing &quot;morally ambiguous&quot; about it. Regarding the &quot;everyone is a parasite argument.&quot; Why are people saying the rich family is leeching? They pay the poor family generous amounts of money and it&#39;s not like they&#39;re doing charity work. It&#39;s a job just like anything else to be a tutor, maid, driver, etc. A job is a two way transaction. So unless I am missing something, the Park family never leeched off of any body. People also argue that Mr. Park is a parasite because without his workers, there would not be a company. But I&#39;d argue that Mr. Park is the one that takes the liability and risk for making a company in the first place, buying property, handling insurance, fees, equipment, manufacturing, resources, etc. If his company goes under, his workers can simply find another job, but he will be screwed.",TeeSharp,2020-06-30T20:39:11Z,0
"Interesting movie.  Nice analysis.  While capitalism does lead to exploitation of an underclass, it does, in fact, allow anyone from the underclass to move into the upper echelon of society.  By the same token, people in the upper echelon can easily move into the underclass.   It happens all the time.  Possibly not in one generation, but often it does.  The same cannot be said of communism.   There,  only people within the government are in the upper class, and everyone else is exploited.  Socialism is somewhere in between, but is likely to have more barriers, not less, to movement from lower to higher...and vice-versa.  The &quot;safety net&quot; protects people from becoming &quot;too poor&quot; (in theory), but also takes so much of their income to pay for it that it makes it harder to advance.",Maverick Doe,2020-06-30T20:22:29Z,0

We can&#39;t expect policies that have worked for these small population countries to work for a country like the US that has a population of almost 300 million as the compound effect is VERY powerful in large population countries.

"Idk, if calling this film &#39;Parasite&#39; is entirely correct, as in the film, as this video explains both families &#39;leach&#39; off of each other. However, I believe that calling this &#39;parasitic relationship&#39; is negative, and dark, I believe that as both of them benefit of each other than it is a symbiotic relation ship... am I not correct in my assessment? I would gladly debate on this topic, if anyone disagrees with me, or cares to improve my statement",Maxim,2020-06-27T20:01:06Z,0
"Did you even watch the video?<br>It&#39;s not a symbiotic relationship, Parasite is a layered definition of what we see. To put it simply, we observe on the outside that the poor family is the parasite leeching off of the rich family, taking advantage of them in order to get good jobs. But in reality, it&#39;s the rich family that is only able to maintain their position because of the poor in the first place. If there were no poor people, the rich could no longer sustain such lifestyles. It would crumble very quickly.",Sydnee Mikumuren,2020-06-28T01:38:56Z,0

"A note to the 564 years to buy that house fact: You won&#39;t ever achieve higher by saving, which is why the note on saving hundreds of years worth of money based on an average or minimum is stupid, and the reason for that is the following; saving as a strategy to retain and increase wealth tied to an income source (like a job) that stays the same or increases too little, is depending on a lineal growth which is tending to 0, because the expenses are the same and the income is the same, which means the savings are never enough to make a difference, plus, the strategy is vulnerable to a psyche of &quot;Now I have more and can allow myself more&quot; which means that when there&#39;s a slight increase in the income, there&#39;s a slight increase in the spending, over the years, when the increase starts getting big compared to starting point, the increase in the spending has become big too, the best example is when a new hire earns the minimum allowed for its job post and education, over the years this person attains a higher pay through a higher job and antiquity/experience, eg: mid-managerial position, but by then this person has stopped spending on the basic needs, own housing, transport and plans with friends, or helping the parents if living with them, instead they pay a mid-tier car, nicer clothing, nicer living, maybe kids, etc... In the worst case they&#39;re thrown in a curve of decrease and they can&#39;t even afford their livestyle, the most fatal flaw of that strategy, and helps to further deepen that situation by the other dinamic involved in this: positive interest and debt. These two can be deemed as the outside factor of the strategy that doesn&#39;t fit in, because they can be exponential, due to the interest rates. Positive interest will refer here to the payments the bank does for lending them your money by keeping it there (what most do, if you&#39;re lending money outside of that context it&#39;s another story) while debt is when  you do the opposite through any entity (bank, institution, person, etc...) the trick is, generally when people get carried out (and most get carried out) they&#39;re inflating their debt more than what they&#39;re collecting from the debtors, the reason being that the payout of the bank is lesser than what they&#39;re expecting from you. Further, the dependance of people on systems of income that depend on their human availabilities and usually 1 only source (this is refering to 1 job or 2 jobs) doesn&#39;t allow them to grow in this regard, and things like having kids when not able to care for them in excellence (hence, making these children bad investments and a way to destroy the savings via increasing the costs while having no new income sources) just make it worse. This is what most people don&#39;t understand and that&#39;s part of why these crazy numbers come up, it is obvious you can&#39;t go as fast as an sports car if you keep doing what the slower cyclist is doing.",juan david restrepo duran,2020-06-27T07:04:11Z,0

"You assume hard work is the only way to climb the social ladder. If that is the case then yeah, all the odds are against you in a capitalistic society. But If you look at the people you show as &#39;rich&#39; today, lets take Mark Zuckerberg, he became rich off an idea. There is not rich keeping him from becoming rich.<br>You ignore the power of knowledge and innovation. Hard work is just the fall back of people who fail at those two. Hard work is never supposed to give you an edge, because everyone is hard working. You take this lack of edge and call it a lack of opportunity when opportunity is always there for people who are intelligent and bring new things.<br>I wonder what society structure you can cook up that is better than this coz there is none.

"​@Jankins Late capitalism specifically describes the dysfunction, injustices, absurdities, and contradictions that are inherent to societies dominated by capitalism. However the sense that capitalism itself is &quot;invisible&quot; isn&#39;t really about the objective aspects of the capitalist production, but in how capitalism has become so pervasive that it, along with it&#39;s dysfunction, injustices, absurdities, and contradictions, has come to be perceived as so normal and natural that we cannot imagine the world any other way (an ideology the late Mark Fisher refers to as &quot;capitalist realism&quot;).<br><br>A great allegory of this is actually provided in another movie by Bong Joon-ho: Snowpiercer. In that movie where a train harbouring remnants of humanity endlessly circles the post-apocalyptic world the train has come to be perceived by nearly all it&#39;s inhabitants, from the brutally oppressed at the back to the ruling classes at the front, as the entire world. Because of their inability or unwillingness to think beyond the world of the train the solution pursued by the oppressed to liberate themselves from their situation is confined to upturning the social hierarchy of the train and installing themselves as the ruling class, therefore perpetuating the brutal system of oppression inherent to the train.",Jack Vac,2020-12-25T20:47:19Z,0

After so much suffering that the poor characters have endured which the Parks have a hand in, they’re unaware of all the instances of suffering and unaware of why the Kims would hate and attack them. The one that suffered the most from their ignorance, the housekeepers husband, is the most insignificant to the Parks, they don’t even know who he is or where he came from when he’s been living under them for 4 years and has been labouring to their benefit. There’s so much motive behind their actions but society will only see their wrongdoings and not the suffering that led up to them.",WHERE ARE THE TURTLES,2020-06-04T15:29:18Z,2750

I didnt see them as the villain, the guy went crazy and attacked the kims, but it was justified in my opinion, im glad he went crazy and killed them tbh because i wouldve just been broken if it showed him crying over his wife. the director knew that and had him go on a rampage because he didnt want to have a clear villain. the kims wouldve been seen as a clear villain if the guy didnt retaliate.

"Interesting video, but the world view of your perspective is I think blames far too much on the ideals of capitalism. People are selfish at the core of their beings, sinful at birth in need of a savior. There is none righteous not even one. There is no economic answer to the problem of poverty, the problem of pain. The solution is Christ&#39;s forgiveness of our sinful nature and his sacrifice which has caused God the Father to look at us and smile, seeing Christ&#39;s goodness instead of our own (which is none at all). The problem of suffering is moral depravity not economics. And I think this movie showed human nature exactly as it is. Rich or poor we are all full of nothing but selfishness. We need the Lord.

"First I&#39;m very grateful for you for having posted such value content. Most of us wouldn&#39;t have been able to interpret the movie and the director&#39;s vision as accurately the way you did here (me included). This one was a real eye opener. Will probably watch it again.<br>Now that we live in such terrifying conditions (neoliberal capitalism...). There are questions that come to mind such as:<br>Isn&#39;t all of this just the workings of human nature?<br>What can be the solution?<br>Before thinking about answering this questions I would like to use quotes from books to establish some undeniabe facts first.<br>About the so called game of rich being winners and poor being loosers. The game of power perhaps?<br>As the great renaissance diplomat and courtier Niccolò Machiavelli wrote, &quot;Any man who tries to be good all the time is bound to come to ruin among the great number who are not good.&quot; The court imagined itself the pinnacle of refinement, but underneath its glittering surface a cauldron of dark emotions-greed, envy, lust, hatred- boiled and simmered. <br>(A Cauldron is a large cast iron pot for cooking or boiling over an open fire, with a large pot and frequently with an arc-shaped hanger. Courtesy of Wikipedia).<br>Meanwhile the court was supposed to represent the height of civilization and refinement.<br>Our world today similarly imagines itself the pinnacle of fairness, yet the same ugly emotions still stir within us, as they have forever. The game is the same.<br>Now these above mentioned ugly emotions... They are just as real as a lighthouse is to a ship, they are principles, they are traits of our human nature. They are as real as a ship smashing into the rocks at night because of ignoring the warning, the lighthouse is signaling. [chuckles...]<br>So in this scenario the cause of all evil in this world roots therefore from human nature. And in light of this we can ask ourselves:<br>What can we do about it?<br>There is one answer that could be:<br>If the world is like a giant scheming court and we are trapped inside it, there is no use in trying to opt out of the game. That will only render you powerless and powerlessness will make you miserable. Instead of struggling against the inevitable (human nature), instead of arguing and whining and feeling guilty, it is far better to excel at power. If the game of power is inescapable, better to be an artist than a denier or a bungler. To transform yourself into a superior actor on the stage of life and enjoy your moment in the limelight.<br><br>The above mentionned answer could certainly be the way to the self-destruction of humanity. Today the ultimate power being the pocession nuclear weapons.<br><br>The other and second answer is the following: (Here I quote the great Osho)<br>[The world is certainly preparing for a global suicide, about that there are not two options - it is becoming every day more and more certain. Naturally you think you have to do somthing to prevent it. (just like my 3 questions in the begining)<br>It is beyond your doing, beyond your control; whatever you do will bring it closer.<br>What can you do? The power is not your hands; the power is in hands which are absolutely stubborn, and they don&#39;t care a bit what happens to humanity. Their ego is their supreme value, the only value. Even though it means their own destruction, they will take the risk; they will destroy whoever the think is their enemy.<br>In the beginning, when this kind of war material was in the hands of two countries, the Soviet Union and America, there was some possibility that they may come to some negociation. Now with the power of nuclear weapons in five countries, the possibility of negociation has become more difficult, more complicated. And by the time when the power will be in twenty-five countrie&#39;s hands. Then the question of negociation does not arise. My suggestion is: time is certainly very short, but it is enough to become enlightned, and it is enough to spread an enlighned atmosphere around the world. That is the only possibility.<br>If we can make the people of the world...not the politicians, leave them aside; they have the power but without the consent of the people  of the world, their power is not of much use. If armies simply say, &quot;No, we are not going to use nuclear weapons,&quot; if scientists simply say, &quot;No, we are  not going to produce any more nuclear weapons,&quot; if the whole intelligentsia of the world unanimously creates a great uproar: &quot;It is not a question of war; wars we have seen in thousands - they have been destructive, but they have not destroyed all life. This is not war, this is simple suicide!&quot;.<br>But these people: the scientists, the armies, the intelligentsia, the poets, the musicians, the mystics, the painters, the actors - the people who have a certain impact on the masses, although they don&#39;t have any power except their individuality and their creativity - if they join hands together, this global suicide can be avoided. Not only suicide can be avoided, but with the same energy that was going to destroy all life, the planet can be turned into a paradise. ]<br><br>Now obviously this went beyond the scope of capitalism and rich and poor but it is all connected<br>But yeah here are two great answers.

"You make some great points, however, I don&#39;t think we can ignore either direction of parasitism. I think ultimately, both families being parasitic on each other points to capitalistic idealism being parasitic on genuine human relationship and society. Vilifying the rich doesn&#39;t really solve the problem. Both the rich and poor are involved in a larger vicious system which idealizes the situation of the Parks. But as we see, the Park&#39;s lifestyle isn&#39;t ideal because even their interfamilial relationships are diminished by this idealization of wealth, and even they suffer the effects of the divisions of class. They try to block out the pain of life, not only as represented by the poor, but also as represented by their own flaws, weaknesses, and suffering. Even they are slaves to the idealization of wealth and wealthy living, and are unable to really be satisfied by it. We see this in the juxtaposition of the Kim family&#39;s assumptions that wealth makes it easier to love, and easier to be nice, and the stark reality that both families really love each other while still struggling to love authentically, and both families uphold a false air of niceness, while still sometimes being truly nice, at least to each other. Neither family is simply virtuous or vicious, but both struggle to be truly nice and loving, especially in the face of the pursuit of wealth.<br>Thus, it does not good to simply treat the rich as the source of the problem. They too are enslaved to the idealization of wealthy living, as even their own attainment of it cannot satisfy, and they are always looking for new sources and displays of affluence to distract from the pain of life. The Kims, insofar as they have affluence to flaunt, do so readily (think of their treatment of the drunk outside their home). Neither family is simply at fault, and both families display a vicious parasitism, even though the lower class Kim family&#39;s parasitism is more visible and more immediately shocking. They are problematic and vicious in different ways, but ultimately they are tied to the same source: Capitalistic idealism. Both families treat wealth as the solution to all problems. Both families are ultimately &quot;destroyed&quot; by this, by the separation, wounding, and death of their members. Though the Parks &quot;escape&quot; the violence and the Kims must face it every day since they are still in their home, it is interesting that it is the Parks home where this all takes place. Both have their lives upended by this cruel reality of capitalist idealism. Both presumably continue in this idealism even in the face of that violence. This is the true horror.",Icepick L,2020-05-22T16:58:37Z,0
"This is a really good explanation of the social classes between the rich and poor. but I feel like you&#39;re failing to see the other side of the coin.<br><br>This film had a very fresh and unpopular theme and I think that&#39;s what set it to be the best picture of the year. Instead of the typical stories where the upper class is about oppressing the lower, it views it in a neutral light about it all. Where most films about social class see things as black and white, Parasite presented it in a shade of grey. That it&#39;s about the parasites in society in general. It goes as far as to sometimes paint the poor as the bad guys, especially when they meet people who were worse off, or &quot;poorer,&quot; than them. I know it sounds terrible to say, but I think that&#39;s what is so bold about this film and what set it apart from your average stories about class. I think it&#39;s the reason why Knives Out wasn&#39;t put on the same level as Parasite, despite it also being about social class. It paints it so obviously who is good and who is bad.<br><br>Bong has said some of this himself, in an interview before the Oscars and please forgive me as I couldn&#39;t find the source, he said something along the lines of, &quot;Growing up, sometimes I thought we were poor but then I would see people who were much worse off than myself and realized we were very fortunate actually, suddenly I felt like we weren&#39;t very poor at all.&quot; I wish I could find the quote but I think it was a spoken interview.<br><br>I might be wrong on this but one of the things that stuck out to me in the film was that there were the many times throughout the movie where the father and mother behave a bit dark showing lack of certain virtues. &quot;I&#39;d be nice too if I were rich&quot; was said by the mother but then is shown she is willing to kill someone to protect their wealth. The father had times where he&#39;s tested on his morality, you can&#39;t shake away the moment when they were getting drunk and he nearly hits his wife and plays it off as a joke. When he is driving the car for the rich dad, he shows a lack of self discipline when he continues to turn around and not pay attention on the road. When the rich father, during the son&#39;s birthday, wanted to pretend to be Indians for his son to enjoy himself, the poor father asks him, &quot;Why do you do all this?&quot; The rich father replies, &quot;Because I love my son,&quot; to which the poor father stops and seems to reflect on that saying &quot;Because you love your son...&quot;<br><br>One of the most important things about the film that would&#39;ve been cool to see in this video is the way the poor perceived what being rich meant, overindulgence. It&#39;s a common theme in films about wealth that some view that being rich means living excessively. To put it more simply, you can still be poor even if you have all the money in the world.<br><br>Also I want to bring up a quote from &quot;All the Money in the World&quot; that I think relates to the overall picture of what being poor can mean. Near the beginning of the film, the father somberly tells Amy Adams, &quot;I&#39;m sorry that we are poor,&quot; and she replies, &quot;We&#39;re not poor, we&#39;re just broke.&quot;",EeveeFall,2020-05-22T09:22:16Z,2

I used to think that the parasite was the rock because of how it imposed on the family but now I realize I missed the whole leech part of being a parasite.,LB,2020-05-21T15:20:28Z,0

"At first, I thought the gas was poison, and that the family would turn into monsters psychologically, and dominate the Parks. This is what I got from the trailer: confusion. I wanted to know what was going on so I watched it and I was so so so so so so wrong. <br>This is why I think the movie is called Parasite. The parasite is in society, society is messed up but doesn’t know how to fix it and when. Society is already engraved in our minds. Rich high up and Poor way down. Even their houses show this the Kims live in a basement with the window on street levels. They are literally and socially below ground and the Parks have a huge house up above ground, with two stories and a backyard. They are way up there. <br>Society is like plastic. It won’t go away for a long time and will start dominating everything. When you try to rip through society you will get pushed back farther. The Kims were trying to rip through but ended up far worse than worse. Losing two family members, one dead, one wanted.",iaka,2020-05-19T00:40:17Z,2

"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgAK-4kPTb8&amp;t=4m52s"">4:52</a> love the video but I&#39;d also like to add that the basement guy is not just an allegory for the hidden lower class under clean and cool capitalism. I think he and his wife are an allegory for North Korean people/ people living in abject poverty. His favourite thing for his wife to do is pretending to be the North Korean newsreader. He worships Mr Park for providing for him, like North Korean people worship their leader. His communication to the outside world is disconnected except for his relative (wife) living outside his prison. The director is introducing the concept of &quot;lower than lower class&quot;, who absolutely cannot afford any of the small materialist pleasures other lower class people might have, and how other lower class people have fear for falling into that position in life, driven crazy by poverty.",Vinvininhk,2020-05-17T07:39:06Z,0

"All I&#39;m thinking about is how at the end, the protagonist and his mother ended up in the basement (their current semi basement house) and the father ended up somewhere worse  (the actual basement of the Park&#39;s house).

It seems like they&#39;ll never escape where they came from - the dirty struggles of living underground, poor. Also, I hate almost every character of the movie. If it isn&#39;t because of their stupidity (the madame especially), it&#39;s because of their cunning (honestly the protagonist fam overtaking the rich people house is a mad stroke of genius that I can&#39;t help but admire but also be disgusted) and their cruelty.

"I understand the disparity between the dirt poor and rich, as I am a broke college student. What I don’t understand is how it is fair to make the rich feel bad for what they have. Yes the poor have to work hard for what they need and some rich folk don’t need anything. But that’s the cards they were dealt. Just because someone had it better doesn’t justify an issue, you have to suck it up and carry on (like many do). Who are we to question them? They are living there own lives. Might some use poor people to do all their work? Yes. But do they have a gun to their head? No. I just don’t think its fair to be mad at the rich for what they have or what they were able to achieve. Instead of being spiteful, go out and become that rich person, if you have to work like a dog then do it, but don’t complain about others having it easy because it will always be like that, there has been a disparity in the powerful and the poor since the dawn of man and it will always be this way. There is no possible way everyone will be on the same playing field, it is up to you if you make the cut.",Dillon,2020-05-06T07:56:16Z,10
"Dillon Because most of the rich don’t “work like dogs” to be where they’re at. People like corporate CEOs profit from the labors performed by lower-working classes that make their money for them, who still find themselves stuck in poverty no matter how hard they work. Jeff Bezos isn’t getting up every day to send out Amazon packages and move boxes around in the warehouses, is he? The end of the movie even touches on this, where Ki-Woo is shown to have made enough money to buy the house like he wrote to his dad. It then pans back to him sitting with a hopeless expression in his home, and the bleak reality that he will never be able to make that much money in his life. No matter how hard someone works, it is nearly impossible for most to achieve such a high economic status, and the notion that anyone can get rich through pure, hard work is a fantasy that tons of people still buy into to this day. If this were even true, there would be a lot less working poor in the world, don’t you think? The whole issue with sucking it up and taking the “cards you are dealt with” is that the “card-dealing” is built upon an exploitative system that favors the rich, making them richer whilst keeping the poor poor at the same time. We live in a broken system, and there’s no reason that the disparity between the rich and poor needs to exist. It does not have to be this way, and it shouldn’t. No one person should have billions of dollars, especially dollars that they’re collecting off the work of the poorer classes they take advantage of. There are so many people who work their asses off and won’t see even a fraction of that amount of money within their lifetime. Still seem unfair to be mad?",Rose I guess,2020-05-20T05:36:30Z,0

"It&#39;s also very interesting how they showed, how far one will go to escape poverty and what poverty forces you to do. The Kims have every worker except Min get fired for their own benefit, to replace their position. As they are getting drunk in the house the father is kind of concerned about the previous driver but Kevin just throws it off, saying he was young and pretty, therefore he must have found anothet job by this time, when in reality there was no way for him to know. Then minutes later when finding out about the previous Housmaids husband and while she plead for help, Mrs. Kim refused to help and even threaten to call the police to gain control over the situation. They were all so caught up on their lie, they forgot they both are still poor and in need of money, but instead of helping they have killed each other. So in reality, they never were concerned for the workers before them, as long as they make it out of poverty, they were willing to fight till death, cause beeing poor was already living hell.<br>Also very interesting is how Kim shames the basement guy for &quot;living like this&quot; but is left speechless when he replies with &quot;a lot of people live in basements&quot;, clarifying that the Kims and him are on the same grade, yet Mr Kim had absolutely forgotten from where he himself came from. I think this is also the reason why he was so hurt by the family saying he smells weird, now having to face reality that they do not think of him or his family as equals as he believed since they were so kind to them, but have seen him just as the lesser being like he saw the basement guy at some point.",Sasha Braus,2020-05-04T09:08:22Z,64

"Hello Broey Deschanel! First off, love the name! Second, I just read your pinned comment, and you don&#39;t need to apologize for putting in that commercial for the skin-whitening product. In fact, it is spot-on! As a Filipino myself, I agree that the obsession of having white (r) skin is ultimately tied to classism. In fact, the commercial explicitly says &quot;para sa puting pang-dyosa&quot;, which (loosely) translates to &quot;white skin like a goddess&quot;. I mean, why? Does this mean if I don&#39;t have white skin, I am not a &#39;goddess&#39;, therefore I am just an ordinary mortal and therefore &quot;less than&quot;? And don&#39;t even get me started on the (strange?) coincidence that the actress in that commercial is Heart Evangelista, who is beyond rich and privileged! Getting back to my point earlier, a discussion on skin color ultimately leads to classism - Refinery29 did this documentary about skin whitening in Asia and the women (a lot of them Filipina) that they interviewed explicitly confirmed that having white skin leads to greater, better opportunities as opposed to having darker skinned.",Jeebs Unabia,2020-05-02T19:55:44Z,0

"I’m very late to this party, but I just realized something. After the whole birthday party disaster happened, none of the rich folks including the Parks had any idea of the secret bunker. The whole thing disappeared from the minds of everyone over the course of the aftermath, but no one actually knew the bunker existed. I think this is actually very genius and reflects back to the car scene in which Mrs. Park is praising the storm. She had no idea of the devastation it caused to the lower class just like she had no idea at all that the threat at the party came from “below”. They are still ignorant of the plights of the lower class. I think this is brilliant! <br><br>Just a little something I noticed. It probably doesn’t mean much",Khadidi,2020-04-29T05:17:02Z,3369

My family and I escaped Iraq and Syria with $22000 in debt because we could not afford the flight to Canada, and we owed money to the furniture company as my dad worked in a factory. 10 years later, I managed to get an engineering degree and paid off nearly $38000 of my own student debt, and now almost paying our $22000 in family debt. Life is truly filled with opportunities if you work hard enough for it. Obviously, some people did not make it out of the middle east.

"This movie wasn’t good. It was overhyped and non coherent in writing. I watched this video till the end, the movie never says any of this. It’s a complete interpretation of the content creator, and if the creators of this movie think the same they’ve done a poor job of conveying that message in the film. This video is U.S. Democratic Party talking points set to the movie in the form of a review, completely interpreted as the narrator saw fit; I believe that “Parasite” is glorified because it’s a foreign film. If it were made in America by White people, starring other White people, then no one would care. The movie was better than a few Oscar picks though, and the gatekeeping in Hollywood as well as their cherry picking is straight up disgusting.

"Overall, I think the moral of the story is that there will alwayss be someone &quot;beneath&quot; you. And there&#39;s no telling exactly how or why. Capitalism is real, poverty is real, but ultimately, death is assured to everyone. And within life, people are always trying to chase the next thing or maintain what they already have- what may seem like greed to some may be practical, even righteous to others. But most people get a taste of each &quot;side&quot; within their lifetime. That&#39;s where privilege gets tricky. Like when rich mom (i watched the movie a while ago so i forgot names) talked about how she used to ride the subway. And the daughter getting to have that bath. I used to live in LA and it is the greatest example of this, probably in the world. You have some of the richest, most successful people in the country living amongst an increasing homeless population. Some of the homeless used to live perfectly normal lives- perhaps even middle or upper class. Yet drugs left them with close to nothing. And yet, the drug crisis is a prominent issue among the upper class as well. I know I went all over the place, but this topic is such a trip.

"Another way this movie describes the divide between the rich and the poor is the direction everything flows. For example, the water flows from the top, where the Parks live, to the very bottom, where it devastated the poor. We also almost never see the Parks go down the stairs in the movie, but rather always go up, while it is the opposite with the poor family, where we almost always see them going down. It shows how this class divide causes all the poor to get the sewage water, the burden on their backs, while the rich constantly keep going up, benefiting from their suffering.",mango OLeaf,2020-04-24T15:53:38Z,0

I think the real downfall of both the poor AND the rich in this film was exactly what the rock represented: the pursuit of wealth and it destructiveness to all humankind---wealthy or poor.

It&#39;s important that he doesn&#39;t say it as Li Su Pec Tu; transliteration implies an understanding through the lens and understanding of another language. <br><br>There&#39;s a strong disdain for the Anglicization or, more accurately, the Americanization of modern Korean culture and language. It was the central theme of Metal Gear Solid V, and is more subtly featured here, albeit indirectly and allegorically.",lefu,2020-10-30T06:45:55Z,2

That plan kiwoo visualized at the end is take of big dreams and little nickels. False hope and instead of going to prison the dad will remain in the basement haunted because as the man of the family he did not do what he needed to do for his family.

This movie filled me with so much dread. I feared so much for each character. This is the world that has been created for people which is based on fear. My own father did humiliating things to keep us children fed and now we are tasked with caring for him and my tired mother plus our own family without work. Suddenly being put out of work and living on money reserved for retirement or education. They never had us in mind though. To these wealthy we are disposable.,sullie,2020-04-03T06:46:54Z,76

"There is also the connection that late stage capitalism is essentially modern feudalism. In feudal times everyone was a servant to their lord, but the servants closest to the lord (such as Knights and squires) held higher social prestige then those serving the lord from outside his sight (the peasants). We see a direct comparison here where the best jobs were those where they directly served the Parks, and not the jobs where they were just cogs in the system. Like the pizza box folding job where they were completely invisible to the ruling elites, but still to a certain capacity serving them.",TheZalor,2020-04-03T03:37:15Z,0

"​@Leo Leyva Being pale was linked to wealth because people could afford to stay indoors, meanwhile poor people were working manual jobs outside in the sun. It has nothing to do with race, they&#39;re not telling black people they need to be pale to be pretty, it&#39;s just their own race thinks being paler is prettier on themselves. I don&#39;t agree with the beauty standard, because I think all skin tones are beautiful, especially the darker South and South East skin tones, but there&#39;s no racial superiority link to the beauty standard. And actually, most European countries see being tanned as the beauty standard. For the same reasons. Having a darker complexion is seen as desirable in many European countries because it was linked to being wealthy in the 1900s and having the time to relax in the sun and go on holiday, while poorer people didn&#39;t have that luxury so didn&#39;t really tan (as European jobs in the 1900s weren&#39;t so much outside jobs as they were in offices and factories). Neither the desire for being pale or for being tanned is racist though, as they&#39;re not enforcing that beauty standard on someone of another race.",kha,2020-05-23T11:15:11Z,15

First, you&#39;ll laugh at how witty the family is then feel really really nervous in the basement part and when the poor family is cleaning all the mess they made. Then the dark concept started to rise during the flood. I literally had goosebumps all over my body when they started killing each other at the party. Never expected the brutal scenes. When I started watching this movie I thought I will laugh all the way out because of the funny scenes of the poor family but damn! This movie is the true meaning of unpredictable. The ending is unpredictable. I am actually speechless when the movie ends. Parasite is far fron what I expected. It raised my standards when it comes to movies. I can&#39;t stop thinking about it!

"The rich mother calls the husband which her son saw a ghost, which could also ressemble how disconnected the different classes are, so disconnected that for the rich People ( and also the other way around) the low class is unreal or unpresent  like a ghost. Then the mother goes on saying that ghosts bring wealth , meaning that poor people ( since the „ghost“ is a poor person)<br>make rich people rich .

"So I went to private school. I grew up a rich bitch. Something very clear but still insidious took over the social order of our school. I know there are always divides of popular kids and unpopular kids but this took it a step further. There was little violence but a lot of enforced social isolation. People who didn&#39;t fit into the proper mold (ie weren&#39;t rich attractive or neurotypical) were bullied relentlessly by everybody. It was like if they had one person to unload all their shit onto then they were safe from social ostracisation, even though the self entitled &quot;popular kids&quot; were always at each others throats and tossed one another aside arbitrarily.<br><br>The very kid who first claimed to me that he was part of the popular crowd was kicked out the next year.

"I stayed in a Hilton hotel in Jakarta. One morning I woke up, drew the curtains, then saw a landscape of slums that contrasted the luxurious swimming pool where people were living their best lives. The direct contrast between the rich and the poor was beyond appalling. The hotel&#39;s swimming pool and outdoor leisure was so vast that it had to squeeze the adjacent slums into disorganized cluster. This speaks volumes about the malice of capitalism in the modern world, how it leeches off the resources of the poor to ensure the comfort of the wealthy. After watching parasite, I couldn&#39;t help but be reminded of this view. So indeed, we should be terrified because economic divide is something very real in today&#39;s society.

"If capitalism is bad and if being rich makes you bad, why do so many poor people aspire to become rich (not to have enough for a normal life, but to get RICH mind you) and also why do those same poor people work for big companies instead of starting their own business based on their own moral principles? Because we&#39;re lazy and like to dream too much and that&#39;s what makes us &quot;poor&quot;. This doesn&#39;t apply to actual homeless but an average poor person in a developed - or even developing country nowadays, lives far more comfortably compared to some king from 300 years ago. You say our worth is measured by how well are we able to work for others, but what&#39;s the alternative? I&#39;ll take this over being valued by how well I can hunt bears. I&#39;m not criticising the movie itself since I didn&#39;t even watch it, but the whole rich people bad thing is just annoying.

"Lol nobody is saying ”rich people bad,” but all rich people do get rich on the backs of poor people. Why don&#39;t you go to a country like Bangladesh, a country where children as young six are working in factories, being treated as slaves, making clothes for us to wear in the west. It&#39;s not that they are ”bad people,” but it is the nature of the system to accumulate and exploit workers as much as they can for profit. Rich people are living in a privilege position. They do not have to be ”evil” because they don&#39;t have to waste their time thinking about paying their bills at the end of every month. And, yeah, People do want to be rich because capitalism gives them false hope that they can. Serfs did not try to get rich under feudalism because they knew it didn&#39;t matter how much they work; it is pretty much impossible for them to get out of the class they were born in. The problem is, how can we tolerate the system that allowed the wealthiest 1% own half the world&#39;s wealth, when children in Africa are dying of hunger. We have to ask ourselves. Can we do better than this?",Leon Wagner 910,2020-03-26T17:46:20Z,0

"I am growing so tired of these anti-capitalism think pieces. They never tell the truth of the matter. They always make blameless the lower class by placing the blame on the upper class. Here are some truths. <br><br><br>1. Capitalism provides opportunity for upward mobility. It does not limit your ability to become the next Steve Jobs or the Next Zuckerberg<br>2. There are two factors that divide classes in a capitalistic society: Intelligence and Motivation. You need them both to rise to the 1%. You can be a genius and spend all your days surfing. You won&#39;t make it then. You can be stupid and infinitely motivated. You won&#39;t make it then either. To be a Bezos, you need both. <br>3. Socialism seeks to limit those with intelligence and motivation for the sake of those that lack one or both. <br>4. Being born without the ability to become a doctor is not the fault of society. And it is not moral to have a governmental system that grants equal outcome rather than equal access. <br>5. The role of government is to enforce equal access to success. Any other type of system necessarily limits a class of people. That is immoral.  <br><br><br>When I was a kid and made a stupid choice, my grandmother would quip &quot;Well, the world will always need ditch diggers.&quot; And she was right. Those that did not win the genetic lottery (and being totally honest here, that is 99% of us) will always be limited by their intrinsic governor. You can not take everyone, send them to med school, and think everyone will overcome their limits with the right education. We can not all be doctors. <br><br><br>Socialism is taking any average Joe off the street and throwing them into the NFL. Then when they under-perform, rather than cutting them from the team,  we start limiting the performance of those around him so that the average Joe&#39;s stats look competitive. That is ridiculous in thought and practice. <br><br><br>Life is a meritocracy. Evolution is a meritocracy. The most successful modern societies all started off as meritocracies. The US is a meritocracy. Making it anything else is counter to human and societal evolution. For the sake of the human race, the weak must be allowed to fail and the strong must be allowed to succeed. Intelligent parents tend to produce intelligent offspring. Stupid parents tend to produce stupid offspring. While stupid parents can beat the odds and produce an intelligent child, this is not the rule. And intelligent parents can produce stupid children. Again, not typical. But who are we to decide the outcome for either?",ballzack57,2020-03-13T19:03:43Z,1
"@shwwnn Self sacrifice for the benefit of your offspring is one of the most noble of endeavors. Most people are doing exactly that. If a parent it limited to only 10 rungs on the ladder, and they realize they can not add more to their own ladder, adding rungs to their children&#39;s ladder is a worthwhile pursuit. Capitalism allows for the generational addition of rungs; socialism does not.",ballzack57,2020-03-18T19:43:09Z,0
"@ballzack57 Not everyone is like that, but there are a lot of people in current society who are sacrificing everything just to earn a little more, when they already have enough. Some people reach success very easily, but a lot of people are reaching what they perceive to be success at the expense of their own health, and their own souls, even.",shwwnn,2020-03-18T19:26:54Z,0
"@shwwnn Again, you premise is just wrong. You assume that everyone wants to move up to the top of the ladder. This is simply not true. <br><br><br>Having only 1 rung on that ladder means that individual liberty is compromised. Having an infinite number of rungs and the freedom to move up or down as the individual sees fit, is the best design. <br><br><br>It is up to the individual to determine their work/life balance. Trust fund kids aside, the successful are not successful because they held other people down. Though, it can appear that way in a meritocracy.<br><br><br>The fact is that biological differences determine how many rungs are on your ladder.",ballzack57,2020-03-18T19:19:19Z,0
"@ballzack57 The lack of humanity is not in the price of labor, it is in the hearts of humans. Capitalism is an ideology just like communism or socialism is. It is the ideology of the pursuit of wealth above, at the expense of, all else, including happiness, and humanity. People sacrifice their own health, well being, and time with their children just so they can move up the ladder even if they are already doing well where they are. Is that not the mark of an ideologue?<br><br><br>When the master sees his stableman eating hay and not feel anything, but just thinks about the money, he is no longer human. When Apple heads know the condition of the factory workers and not feel anything, but just think about money, they too are no longer human. If the master of the stableman only agrees to pay more because all workers have banded together and forced him to, he&#39;s still no better than before. Only when he decides to live for something other than just money, but also for himself, for his heart, to allow it to feel things it has the ability to feel, and to do things more meaningful and beautiful than just the pursuit of wealth at the expense of all, including his own soul, does he become human.<br><br><br>Otherwise he&#39;s just a more skilled parasite.<br><br><br>Workers do not generally band together because there&#39;s not enough love among them. Where there&#39;s love, there is unity, solidarity, loyalty. Without it, there is none of those things. <br><br><br>The rich and the poor suffer from the same condition, that makes the society the way it is.",shwwnn,2020-03-18T19:02:27Z,1
"@shwwnn The presupposition of your opening statement is faulty. We &quot;deserve&quot; nothing. <br><br>The humanity, or lack there of, in the price of labor is consequential. My argument is not counter to that idea. My argument is that it is not the role of government to set that value. To do so would require a devaluation of the top for the benefit of the bottom.  This can seem benevolent but, it is immoral. <br><br><br>Unions were formed by the wage-earners in order that they set their own valuation of their labor. This is the best way forward. At least in my opinion. <br><br><br>Globalism makes unionizing more difficult and possibly impossible. Why pay $20 per hour here in the States when that same labor can be purchased for $2.00 overseas? <br><br><br>The answer to this quandary is yet unknown. But, if all the ditch diggers refused to dig for anything less than a livable wage, then they would either need to find a new job, or they would get a livable wage. <br><br>This is the point of the movie. Not that capitalism is bad, but that the ditch diggers do not cooperate for the greater good of them as a class. <br><br><br>I lost a business in the early 2000&#39;s because cheap immigrant labor came in and said they would do the job for less than I could comfortably live on. I was not willing to become working class poor. If none of the native labor would have accepted the new lower wage, then none of us would need to look for other work. <br><br><br>Getting people to work for the greater good is difficult. It is far easier to have the government force it by laws and regulations. But I will likely never support a government picking winners and losers.",ballzack57,2020-03-16T20:20:14Z,0

"Too much anti-capitalism in the analysis. Yea, it&#39;s all kinda correct, but it&#39;s not the capitalism that is screwing people. It&#39;s PEOPLE that are screwing people, and that&#39;s just because that&#39;s what people do. <br><br>And don&#39;t forget that communist and socialist countries have inequality too, and in terms of communist countries, the inequality is actually way larger than in capitalist countries. Communist countries just take the capitalist approach of companies-rule-all and merge all the comanies into a single company, then merge that one company with a government and voila, you just made a communism out of capitalism. Communism is is literally the extreme version of capitalism, with a single government-company body ruling all. <br><br>The trick is to keep the ruling class fragmented and divided. They will still be powerful, but as long as they&#39;re fighting each other just the right amount, it can find its chaotic balance of least-evil.<br><br><br>Ofcourse it would be much better if it was not necessary to have it this way, and all people were just good to each other. But it would also be better if cancer didn&#39;t exist, mosquito bites tickled and if people could regrow lost limbs. Neither of those are reality.",therflash,2020-03-13T11:20:16Z,0

"I don’t think they are in the same exact social class. With this movie’s use of vertical camera work, we see that the poor family lives in a basement apartment, but there is a window still shining light through. Personally, I think the light symbolizes privilege and hope. However, the former maid and her husband are completely underground, with no light at all. I feel that the mother does not chose to acknowledge that she is poor like the couple because in this socioeconomic hierarchy, she has more privilege then the couple in the basement. There are people that are below the social class of the poor family, which shows that it is not just rich, middle-class, and poor. There are different subgroups of all of them that are more privileged than others.<br><br>This film did not just portray the conflicts between the rich and poor. It also showed how the different subgroups of the poor fight each other to have a chance to move up this social hierarchy.",Jaanvi Reddy Muchanthla,2020-08-08T15:04:12Z,13

"Your conclusion is that the parasitical nature of the rich outweighs the parasitical nature of the poor. I think this missing a huge part of the movie. You could say that the Kims were forced to be manipulative to survive their poverty but that would be ignoring their nature. At the beginning of the movie, they are seen doing a repetitive task, folding pizza boxes, for money. However, they put in the absolute least amount of effort possible. This reveals that yes, society and the rich are pushing them down into poverty, but the Kims are also doing it to themselves through laziness. I think that the parasitical nature of both classes were seen equal to eachother in this film. I am not necessarily disagreeing with overarching argument, only the evidence from the film you based it upon.",John Luca,2020-03-12T03:30:29Z,1

"understood and agreed. But this is the only way it would work, almost no good-hearted communistic intentions set up on paper has ever survived nor worked for the better in reality. Every country promotes the free-market because it makes them rich, and they exploit poorer countries because it keeps them rich. And if they become poor, they get bullied by others or even destroyed. The competitive nature of human society is the root cause but we have no way of removing that from this society, arguably horrifying yet working for all beneath it. We are all parasites eventually, and anything we get is essentially taken away by harming something. Yet our intuitions are to survive. So my conclusion?

"Just subscribed! Not only were you informative but you asked a good question of &quot;Who are the parasites?&quot; <br><br>The kind of NeoLiberal Capitalism that has arisen in society is a lot more pervasive than we are willing to admit. Even I have this mentality of &quot;I have worked for this, why should anyone else benefit from it&quot; that convinces me to believe in less taxation, deregulation and free trade. Imagine going from even low class and working your way to middle class only to realize that the government will tax you more now because of your income bracket. The thought of actually working more, working harder, only to then earn a smaller percentage of what you expected to make is quite disheartening and my knee-jerk response is to say &quot;government, please stay away from it.&quot; <br><br>But then I realize it&#39;s definitely the mentality of the rich as well. I am talking about those who earn disparate amounts of annual income who have convinced themselves they work hard enough and have managed the company enough that they deserve not to be taxed as much. And so, they either send their money off to tax havens, find loopholes in tax law (why U.S. tax law is so damn complicated), or some other way to get out of paying what is required by law. And guess what - when they even manage to fail like they did back in 2007-08, they have convinced the rest of society, the government that they need these bail outs because they are too big to fail. It&#39;s okay when they ask for financial support but for anybody else within society, good luck. <br><br>The reality that Parasite conveys at the end of the day is that everyone has blood on their hands. Every single consumer in a first world country to those even rising to the top. The only reason why people do not see it that way is because we have a monetary system that keeps things &quot;civil&quot; when in reality we have traded one bad thing for something worse - exploitation, low-paying wages, treating humans like machines, lying to employees by convincing them to work through bad circumstances, etc. Want to see an example of this? Watch Netflix&#39;s American Factory and see how NeoLiberal Capitalism accomplishes this... (I&#39;m sure the rich cannot wait for machines to be their full-time employees. But, in the meantime, they will settle for full-time employees who are willing to accept themselves as mere machines).",KaijuJedi,2020-03-09T20:24:35Z,2

The wife and the children have very clearly not worked hard though so what they have is purely privilige and luck.<br>I do agree that the poor family here of course is the parasite and they do awful things throughout the movie and are bad people but like some people here say poverty makes you more reckless and crime rates are higher because you feel like there is no other way<br>The son of the poor family was clearly intelligent but he kept failing his tests probably because he had to keep helping his family to work all his odd jobs in order for them to survive. <br>Saying just working hard is enough is simply untrue",Sose Hose,2020-04-11T00:44:16Z,0

"Despite all your pre-programmed Marxist buzzwords and platitudes, &quot;neo-liberalism&quot; has provided this planet, developed and developing countries, with the most amount of socioeconomic mobility in human history. it used to be that your entire worth was judged by your bloodline, royalty, religious status, skin color, sex etc. Sure some of those superficial restrictions still exist, but mainly your socioeconomic status is determined by CURRENCY according to this video. At least this is something that can be earned and traded and lost. It&#39;s quantifiable. It&#39;s not perfect but its the best thing so far in measuring a human&#39;s input-output ratio and their perceived value. Capitalism is the worst system in the world, except for all the other ones.<br><br><br>Capitalism is not a sufficient requirement for freedom, it is a necessary one. In every place capitalism exists there isn&#39;t always freedom, but every place freedom exists, there is capitalism.",Bryson Contreras,2020-03-09T13:16:58Z,8
"Bryson Contreras You are the child apparently...Did you assume that I wasn’t thinking about the millions of people that suffer in underdeveloped countries as well? How could you fail to bring up how America and other western nations hoard their wealth?  The wealth they stole from so called “underdeveloped” countries. Or how companies like Apple and Nestle use cheap labor and damn near slavery to produce their some thousand dollar products. THAT IS CAPITALISM! I speak for the entire world when I say NOBODY should have to suffer! If you would get YOUR head out of your ass along side the rest of the people that think like you then maybe you/we could brainstorm other forms of government. There is more to governmental structure than democracy &amp; communism. In fact there are about 30 different forms of government. Besides, who said anything about converting to an entirely different form of government anyway? Not that it hasn’t been taken into consideration but let’s start by perfecting the flaws that lie in the Democratic and capitalistic systems first. People like Andrew Yang, Bernie Sanders, Bobby L. Rush, and many more ARE and HAVE BEEN putting ideas to light to fight the overall injustice of Capitalism..You just aren’t listening and it seems like given the opportunity you wouldn’t. So if you do reply to this don’t expect a response. Don’t assume it was because I felt treated or something. I just don’t feel like wasting my energy on shoving something into someone’s face that was right in front of them the whole time. <br><br>P.s.

"@Maya S. I agree with wanting progress. Completely uprooting the fundamental socioeconomic system that 90% of the globe runs on is not progress. That&#39;s what you&#39;re asking for when wanting to radically revolutionize capitalism. What&#39;s your alternative? Your solution? Communism? we all share the money, abolish profits and property to sing kumbaya?<br><br><br>&quot;How could capitalism possibly be the best when so many people suffer from it?&quot;. it&#39;s like asking, how can cars be the best when so many people die from them? I&#39;m sorry, but having to eat Mcdonalds every day, only having one laptop with shitty internet and having to take public transport is not suffering. Our definition of suffering is so flimsy and loose nowadays, BECAUSE of capitalism. You have no idea how good you have it. I&#39;m talking about Western nations, not undeveloped countries. They can show you true suffering and I guarantee you it is not from capitalism<br><br><br> &quot;No one should have to suffer&quot; lol okay. get your head out of your ass and come to reality. I&#39;m not engaging with a child. LIFE IS SUFFERING.

"The parasite(s) in the film are the members of the poor family. In the very beginning they are shown stealing wifi. When a password is put in place they make multiple guesses at it in order keep using something that they aren’t paying for. <br>When they turn in the pizza boxes for payment. They try to swindle money out of the two young kids running the business regardless of the shoddy work they did folding them. <br><br>When the son gets hired by the rich family they then put together various schemes to steal the jobs of the other employees. Going so far as to kill them in order to maintain their hold on the Parks. <br><br>The Park family is shown as model citizens. The dad works hard every day. He’s home every evening with his family. Taking them on weekend getaways. Making sure his son has a wonderful birthday. Taking care of his wife. He even remarks about the horrid behavior of the driver to have sex in his car. “Don’t we pay him well?” They’re trying to do the right thing. While the Kim family is sneaking around and stealing whiskey and food. The Kims want to put in the minimum investment while getting the largest return. Everyone in the Kim family are good at what they do (driving, teaching, and house managing). But they would rather destroy everything than just do what is right.  <br><br>What frightens me is everyone who watched this movie is on the side of the conniving MURDERING thieves. Rather than the people who are providing jobs for others and a good life for their kids.  <br><br>Also, if you stink, then have some respect for yourself and others and wash that smell away.  This is a typical thought pattern in todays modern society. Everyone else is the problem and I have no responsibilities.

"...Video does a good job of pushing socialism and interventionism. I could debunk the misunderstandings about economics or the points where interpretations are willfully taken in a direction to push the narrative, but I&#39;ll go straight to the main point instead. The entire narrative is based on a set of premises that misses one extremely important key fact. One that makes the whole of the narrative crumble. For those that don&#39;t get it on their own, here goes:<br><br>If neoliberalism keeps rich people rich and poor people poor, and specially if the idea that poor people can become rich by effort is a constructed lie, as the narrative of the video claims, and as is reinforced in the video&#39;s description, where neoliberal capitalism is outright pointed as &quot;the boogie man&quot; of the film, then why the BRRT[A-10 sound] do we have examples of rich people becoming poor, and more importantly, of poor people becoming rich? Specially considering that the cases of poor people becoming rich only happen (to people who are not dictators or corrupt government officials, or affiliates to those) in capitalistic societies, and further, specially noting the direct correlation to economic freedom (ie, among other things, less bureaucracy and intervention)?<br><br>Why are the non-neoliberal, non-capitalistic societies that end up in economic, and thus eventually societal, disaster and ruin? While economic freedom and less government intervention is directly correlated to economic success and reduction of the poor?<br><br> 🤔  🤔  🤔  🤔  🤔<br><br>If you are in favor of (more?) interventionism of any kind, I&#39;ll ask you (any reader) to put your biases and (mis-?)conceptions about capitalism aside for a second, and think about this next point, and think about it seriously: Maybe, just maybe, it&#39;s <b>****not****</b> that the pro-captalism argument is based on ideas that the poor are parasites of the rich (as outright stated in the video at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgAK-4kPTb8&amp;t=12m51s"">12:51</a>), but rather, based on the realization and understanding that:<br><br>EVERYONE is affected by taxation. SPECIALLY the poorer, at any given wealth level, since the richer (at that wealth level or the ones above it) can offset the cost of taxation by pushing it down the suply/demand line through raising the prices of their products, or avoid it entirely by moving their assets away somewhere with less taxation. The later case being specially bad for the poor, since now they not only have to deal with the cost of taxation, but they have to do so with less choice about their work and their pay (since some or all of the rich moved their assets, ie factories, ie jobs away). --- Basically, &quot;the rich&quot; is everyone, because everyone is rich to different extents; and &quot;the rich&quot; aren&#39;t retarded, and if you try to take money away from people, no matter what level of rich they are, they will do their best to preserve it.<br><br>If you are in favor of intervention in the economy or socialistic measures to &quot;help the poor&quot;, you are in favor of hurting people and businesses through taxation or bureaucracy. And if you are in favor of hurting people and businesses, you are ultimately AGAINST the poor. Because:<br><br>---That very rich guy? Is not going to be taxed, or deal with bureaucracy on his businesses, more than he is willing to be; if you over-tax him or his company, he will move himself and/or his company away, along with all the related assets, because he can, and he doesn&#39;t have to deal with the BS you created.<br>---That not-so-rich guy? Same as the rich guy, except with more limited options. If you over-tax him or over-burden him, he might not be able to move away; but that small business that he planned to build with the money he managed to save from the past 5 years? Yea, he gave up on that for now, and the money is stuck in the bank earning him dividends to offset the higher taxes you directly or indirectly created.<br>---That kinda-poor guy? Same as the not-so-rich guy, except with even less options. He was working part-time, and spending the spare time getting himself a better education than he currently has in order to move up in life, but he got fired when the factory he worked at closed down to move to another state or country; turns out he was employed by the very rich guy who is moving his stuff away. So now he has to work full-time with over-time just to pay the bills, since, you know, there are less jobs and taxes are higher.<br>---That actually poor guy? He is either dying of hunger on the streets, or having to rely on charity (forced by government as, haha the irony, more taxes; or, preferably, voluntary), instead of being independent, thanks to <b>****not****</b> getting a job created, maintained, or freed by any of the guys above. All thanks to your intervention that was, ironically, intended to help him.<br><br>The reasons communism fails is not exclusive to communism. Economy, when left free, is self-regulating through supply and demand, and most problems people point to as being the fault of liberalism actually stem from interventionism. Lastly, unforeseen consequences are the bane of any interventionist idea or ideals. Socialists and interventionists aren&#39;t evil. I get where you come from. I was one of you not too long ago. But you have to realize that the economy goes a LOT deeper than your top-level, superficial analysis (and if you think your analysis is not superficial, you&#39;re wrong; because even the very best economist only has a superficial understanding of economics; there are so many factors that noone can claim they fully understand economics; and those who do are lying; that&#39;s how deep it goes). There are consequences to consequences to consequences (...). And your objective might be a utopia, but the paths that point toward those utopias, without exception, actually lead to either distopias or economic ruin.<br><br>If you want to learn at least the least-wrong path, it&#39;s to let the market self-regulate instead of trying to regulate it. And if you want to understand why, well, no one has the ultimate answer (those that claim they do, again, are lying), but Mises and the libertarians seem to have figured out a lot of this stuff. They don&#39;t know any magic answers to poverty, but at least they figured out what doesn&#39;t work and why, and statistics on economic freedom worldwide prove they are right or at least the least wrong.<br><br>Lastly, remember: The true enemy is not wealth inequity; it&#39;s lack of wealth. It really doesn&#39;t matter if the richest 1% can afford a f*****g interplanetary space-ship, if the poorest can afford a house and a car. It&#39;s when the rich go away, together with the jobs they create, and the poor are struggling to feed, that we get the real problems. --- Wealth distribution often presents itself as an exponential curve on a truly free market. The poor are many, and the rich are few and REALLY rich. And so people often think that that must be the root for the problem of poverty, when actually, it&#39;s not. The problem is how low is the bottom at the start of the distribution. And counter-intuitively, often, the easier it is for the rich, and more of &quot;the rich&quot; there are, the higher that bottom also is, and the less poor are &quot;the poor&quot;.",Rodrigo Legendre,2020-03-09T05:40:49Z,1

In reality. Their conditions were intollerable to live in. but in a true capitalist society they could&#39;ve applied for a job with the experince they gained at the house hold. surely someone would&#39;ve hired workers from such a reputable family. i know it&#39;s hard to think of expanding and net working when you&#39;re poor but when you really want something in life you have to prevail and not blame others. we all were born in situations that we didn&#39;t chose and we all have to do the best we can. does this mean the rich should be ignorant of the poor? No. But keep in mind a lot of the rich kids are born into enviroments of ignorance just as the poor kids were born into poverty. which would you rather be born into? a situation where you have to fight to live but you love your family and are happy? or a family that you tolerate and you&#39;re dull to happiness because you&#39;re over exposed to nice things.

You talk about all these problems with capitalism in today’s society... but you havnt brought you a single solution. I assure you socialism takes the same power that the upper class has and gives it to governing people. Only in socialism... there is no middle class. <br>I see a problem with out sourcing. I despise all companies that outsource because that is down right exploitation and practically a loophole against minimum wage.

"Edit: Okay I admit I did not see the news actually saying Mr. Park was killed proper. Completely my bad.<br><br>I&#39;d like to pose an argument that further cements the disparity between the Parks and the Kims<br><br>Mr. Park didn&#39;t die.<br><br>To explain: If you look at the scene in particular in which Ki-Jung and Mr. Park were stabbed, you can see that they were both blatantly stabbed in exactly the same place, the intermediate spot between the shoulder and the chest. Now as you all might know, not much really important exists in that particular spot, maybe a bone or large artery/vein. Getting stabbed in that spot might be incredibly painful, but in these days of our advanced healthcare technology, you most certainly wouldn&#39;t die.<br><br>However, what happens to them both after the fact is very telling of this disparity. You see Kim Ki-Jung effectively covered in blood, losing it really profusely. Her fate determined at that very moment. Mr. Park, on the other hand, has a nice clean stab, something that could easily be fixed by the best medical care he can afford. Now I understand that it was never explicitly stated that Mr. Park didn&#39;t die or not, but judging by the fact that one was losing blood so quickly and the other might as well have been clean as a whistle, I think that it&#39;s easy to say that Mr. Park&#39;s money and status protected him from death.<br><br>Considering the overall theme of how the Parks separate themselves from the impoverished to a disgusting degree, I think this argument is rather sound.",M5,2020-03-08T01:57:27Z,244

"In regards to the &quot;Eurocentric beauty&quot; thing, that&#39;s actually culturally rooted in many of those countries because of poor people being required to work outdoors and therefore tanning more than their wealthy counterparts in the past.

"it&#39;s definitely not either one thing or the other. yes, in my country we already had general colorist sentiments but then we were colonized by white people, and it became even more deep-rooted because of oppression that white people are superior. then we started consuming western media, where majority of the representation was white. all of these factors contributed to the rise of fairness creams and whitewashing, and our own entertainment industry propagated those same ideas of fairness by trying to imitate the west. colorism in asia is quite complex and differs from country to country so i dont think the video is misrepresenting it entirely but i think modern instances like consuming western entertainment in general also definitely does have a lot to do with colorism in asia in today&#39;s age. ofc i&#39;m not an expert lol so feel free to correct me if you think i&#39;m wrong, i&#39;m just basing this on what i grew up with and how consuming western media disproportionately (+ the subsequent erasure of my own culture over time due to colonialism) shaped my life and perception. our standards of beauty were indeed eurocentric during the late 20th century onwards because that was what we mainly consumed.",dora,2020-05-31T17:27:15Z,2

"Hi, good video, definitely dropping a like and subscribing. However, I want to pick out one fallacy that you put forward which is probably due to your own Eurocentrism and possibly a bit of projection and lack of cultural awareness. Light skin has been a beauty standard in many cultures but particularly in East Asian cultures since ancient times. The Geisha&#39;s white make-up were not inspired through some sort of masochistic reverence for European white skin for instance. In fact, this light skin beauty paradigm is actually more relevant to your analysis than you might realise.  It is better explained through class; as people with darker skin/tans were usually the worker-class who stayed in the sun all day and did all the dirty, sweaty, hard-work so darker skin -&gt; lower class, light skin -&gt; upper class. This is a beauty standard deeply rooted in many cultures in Eurasia and the Middle East and has very little to do with colonialism as you purport in your addendum. In fact, if we were to go down the rabbit-hole of colonialism in the case of Korea, they were only ever subjugated by other east Asian dynasties like Imperial Japan, Mongols and various Chinese dynasties.",Dungaree Doo,2020-03-07T09:34:36Z,0

"The economic system was supposed to be just a barter system. Accumulation of wealth shouldn&#39;t have been a competition like it has become in our society. It should have been there to ensure that everyone gets what they need. There&#39;s enough for everyone&#39;s need but not enough for everyone&#39;s greed. But at this point, greed and corruption are almost as much a part of humankind as religion, fear, anger, lust and love are. There&#39;s no running from it. The government, the people, the proletariat have to constantly keep each other in check, but the first thing we must do is recognize that no class or faction or race is evil for just being different. We must all recognize and look within our own communities and classes to see and root out the evil ones that allow the other side to generalize us. These rich/poor divides, hatred for the other kind of human beings, things like this have existed ever since the first apes started walking upright and will always exist. It will take a huge amount of technological progress to bring the society to a level that almost every person is one day able to afford to have his needs fulfilled and the rich and greedy will have enough to fulfil their greeds. Some say this isn&#39;t possible because resources are finiite, but the whole universe is almost infinite. There is enough for everyone&#39;s greed and needs, we just need to go get it by developing the technology. One day that will happen and we will all be able to live and think. It is at this point that humanity will learn to retrospect and see the endemic problems that trouble it as a civilization. Until that day we must all learn to do the hustle or be parasites.",karankenZ,2020-03-06T22:52:52Z,0

"The rich family recoils from the smell because they know what personal choices have created the smell. Even the young boy recognizes that there is a smell. And let&#39;s be honest, for those of us who live in inner cities or work with people who live in circumstances like these, know there is a very real smell and you know what personal choices resulted in the smell. It has virtually nothing to do with a lack of opportunity and everything to do with personal choice. The South Koreans are well aware of what is happening within the country to their north and are afraid of it. So as difficult as life is even when you try to make proper choices, there is still the ability to try. To work. To become educated and work you way out of your circumstances.

It&#39;s because a lot of people don&#39;t care. We haven&#39;t reached the level of unity to care about other human lives. The only reason this is happening is because late stage capitalism. Majority of the people are working hard and trying to do their best to help themselves and families. So they don&#39;t have the momentum to think about others. This keep on adding to the wealth Gap. And adds to the inability to understand those who have less money. this is why you keep on hearing a lot of things about poor people that aren&#39;t true. stuff like poor people are lazy and they should work harder to reach the American dream.

"Sorry but the statement that  &quot;Neo-Liberal capitalism takes economic responsibility away from the government and places it in to the hands of free-market institutions and private individuals&quot; is quite obvious nonsense. Economic responsibility never belonged to the government to begin wit. It belongs to the free-market institutions and individuals who generate the wealth. It is in fact the government that must take that responsibility away from private institutions and individuals, those who make up the economy and thus collectively share the responsibilities of managing it. It is the government that must use force to intercede in the economy. Free-market capitalism is the natural state of human economic behavior, not some cruel invention imposed upon humanity, and the period in time in which economic responsibility was denied to the people who made the wealth by the government was the period we refer to as FEUDALISM. Which is exactly what these &quot;socialist&quot; and &quot;communist&quot; societies degenerate in to. The example you yourself have used of sweat shop factories in China, &quot;communist&quot; China, are proof of that. Feudalism only ended when power began to become dispersed, through democratic ideals, to the wider society. The free market is the result of a free society.",Vurtigone III,2020-03-05T12:47:36Z,0

"I love your flipped interpretation where the rich are actually also living off the hard work of the poor in a parasitic way, just as the poor family here are parasites and living off the rich family. But if you take it one step further, if two species are parasites of each other, it&#39;s actually no longer a parasitic relationship, but a symbiotic one. This means that contrary to the doom and gloom that this movie portrays, in reality the rich need the poor to work hard and the poor need the rich to give them scraps - a mutually beneficial relationship is possible, unlike what this movie leads you to believe (most people are not nearly as inhumane as what is shown in the film - rich people do give and give generously through philanthropy and poor people do show gratefulness as well). This movie is deliberately pessimistic, but there are always stars of hope in the vast sea of darkness in the night sky. Parasite intends to terrify and I agree with that - but without an optimistic interpretation, it comes off as heavily unbalanced - one of the main reasons I did not enjoy the film despite it&#39;s well-crafted cinematography.",xSaberFaye,2020-03-04T15:32:17Z,0

"I recently watched Parasite. At first I thought<br>&quot;Yeah it&#39;s good, but... HOW DID THIS WIN THE OSCARS?&quot;<br><br>The plot and theme was kinda simple with an added shock-factor in the end, but other than that, I&#39;ve seen anime with better shizz...<br><br>I watched it with the premise that this movie was supposed to show the desparity between social classes, but I failed to see how the movie highlighted it. The rich gave them jobs, treated them and compensated them fairly, and yet the Kim Family seemed like they wanted to take everything.<br>They&#39;re cunning, and very underhanded, a textbook Parasite to their &quot;host&quot;. It definitely showed why the movie was called &quot;Parasite&quot;, but I was desperately looking for the &quot;Rich Vs poor&quot; desparity thingy that critiques always say. I really couldn&#39;t.<br>Yeah, I get that the Kim family is poor, but it didn&#39;t show enough of the &quot;struggle&quot; or they only showed minamal scenes of their poverty which in all honesty, looked like the border between a middle class and lower class here in the Philippines.<br>So I finished the movie feeling pissed at Mr. Kim for doing something so heinous over something so petty...<br><br>But then I started reading discussions about it and explanations to why such scenes were portrayed and the cinematography involved.<br><br>And then it hit me... The reason why I sympathize with the Parks more and why I was left dumbfounded by the ending...<br><br>I FORGOT TO CHECK MY PRIVILEGE...<br><br>I lack empathy towards what the Kim family goes through to even consider why they&#39;d go to such lengths to be &quot;parasites&quot;.<br>Also a lack of understanding on what &quot;Korean Poverty&quot; is and how their society works. Also the pride and dignity that the Kim family puts at stake and how they want to regain it.<br><br>Makes me realize that I&#39;m probably part of the problem that was being highlighted in the Movie.<br><br>Guess that&#39;s why it won oscars and other awards.

He doesn&#39;t deny the young guy calling himself a loser and in fact leans into it by saying he chose him because he didn&#39;t want to risk the other university students stealing the girl away from him (whereas he didn&#39;t think the young guy would be able to).

"This video is starting to sound like propaganda against capitalism and so is this movie. The government should have nothing to do with individual success nor should we be rewarding people who do not work, I do think tho we should try and make our society function where if you work hard you will succeed which is how it was until global corporations created the real problems. The Parks may perpetuate unsavory ideals, but in no way were they deserving of death or violence merely because they looked down on poorly folk, they didn&#39;t actively try and push them down they just were employers to these people. And due to what they said about the lower class family that resulted in violence which I would say makes the poor family immoral and they got what was coming, not to say the rich family didn&#39;t get what they deserved either. In the end, capitalism is a good thing and DOES afford equal opportunities, there should never be equal outcome because in societies like that we see everyone ends up with nothing equally. The majority of individual capitalists create more jobs and wealth than they get credit for (pretty much all of it), and they end up getting lumped in with corporations which are masses of power that stand outside of individuality or humanity, they are the enemy, not the Park family or capatilism.",Ainsley Harriot,2020-03-01T20:53:42Z,1

"After looking back on the movie, I just remembered that scene where Kim Ki-taek (poor father) is waiting to meet the rich father, and the rich father is talking about virtual reality. He asks if it can work with a phone. A man replies, “No, the phone doesn’t have enough power.” Cut to a few minutes later in the film and the fate of the family hangs in the hands of a phone, described as having the same power as a “North Korean missile.” Just another one of Bong Joon-ho’s masterful metaphors and set-ups. This can also be considered a reference to the beginning of the film, where the family is struggling to get wi-fi, a commodity they desperately need. Here they are, desperate for this phone, their only lifeline, while the wealthy family looks down upon it for “not having enough computing power.”",Krypt,2020-03-01T20:04:00Z,3

"@moises bernal When I say &quot;The data about it is overwhelming&quot; I do not say that lightly: just check the data from the UN (a really anti-capitalist organisation), the world bank, and even independent sources like <a href=""http://ourworldindata.org/"">ourworldindata.org</a>: poverty is in an all-time low around the world; less than 9% lives in extreme poverty, and funny enough, it started shrinking rapidly since the 80s, when &quot;neo-liberalism&quot; took over. You can check it here <a href=""https://ourworldindata.org/extreme-poverty"">https://ourworldindata.org/extreme-poverty</a>. So I don&#39;t really know where you get that figure of the 99% besides from the constant lazy leftist propaganda, something that can only find refuge in weak and uninformed minds.<br><br>That&#39;s the reason why inequality has become the new priority for the left, because poverty would be a thing of the past in a few decades.

Theres thar false hope of social mobility that the film discusses. Yes a few people have gotten extremely lucky and used their limited connections to achieve class mobility. But what about the other 99.9% of others who are stuck beneath the boot of Neo-Liberal capitalism. It tries to paint the idea that class mobility is possible but in most cases thats just the false hope used to keep the working class complacent and working for the rich. Women and children working in sweatshops across the world dont have social mobility. impoverished Americans dont have class mobility. The only class mobility that exists is Rich to Richer. It has nothing to do with partisan politics and more to do with the reality of the situation we live in under capitalism,moises bernal,2020-03-03T00:06:33Z,0

"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgAK-4kPTb8&amp;t=5m37s"">5:37</a> That&#39;s an interesting point, it made me realize that we see that a lot in the movie. Son ki-woo hiding beneath the rich girl&#39;s bed, the Kims hiding beneath the table as the parks are having sex above them. Having to endure the degradation of them talking about  the father&#39;s smell and being turned on by the daughter&#39;s underwear. Sitting through that scene was so mortifying, I can&#39;t imagine what actually being there and for the whole thing would have felt like. The contrast between those trying to survive beneath them and those enjoying something frivolous like perverted sex right above them also struck me (and then having to continue business as usual while pretending nothing happened). <br>And then there&#39;s of course those living in the basement beneath them, the parks completely oblivious to its existence and their existence, just as they are oblivious to those living in half-basements, enduring floods and practically living in the sewage(again symbolic to something beneath us that we ignore in everyday life, but allows us a safer, cleaner life above), while they enjoy the luxury of their isolation on their house on the hill. <br>Another interesting thing about this is how the kims are desperate  to keep the couple in the basement a locked secret while they walk above them, pretending to belong. Very symbolic to their situation and society in general and also relates back to what you pointed out about the struggle between the poor and poorer. <br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgAK-4kPTb8&amp;t=8m33s"">8:33</a> In another video about the movie someone pointed out that they expect them not to cross the line but constantly cross the line themselves. Like when they promptly ask them to join the birthday party, not really caring for their opinion or when mister kim is asked by mister park to perform for their child in a silly costume even though he clearly doesn&#39;t want to and it isn&#39;t his job. <br><br>What&#39;s really shocking about this movie to me is two things, the first is that the rich and the general public have not only learnt nothing after this, but never even realized what it is that took place the entire time. They&#39;ll probably continue living just thinking they were some crazy poor people and that poor people can&#39;t be trusted. They wouldn&#39;t care the daughter died, that the kims were injured, and one ended up trapped in a basement, or why. The father will never know there was a man living in a basement beneath him for years who admired him, and none of it will matter. <br>The second thing is that there was no happy ending for the kims, and wealth remained unobtainable, the final scene where it was presented as an illusion created the same sense of false hope for the audience as for the kims, only to then break it, leaving us in bleak basements and half-basements of false yearning, the kims worse off than before, in different states of ruin, from death to being locked up and torn apart, to being on the verge of insanity.",LandAhoy,2020-03-01T15:36:41Z,569
"@karina Yes, exactly. Like I said in one of my replies here, I don&#39;t think anyone in this movie is &quot;good&quot; or presented as such,  it can be argued some are worse or deserve worse, but it&#39;s only the poor who&#39;ll get punished for their actions at all. <br><br>Yes, that scene was really disturbing to me too. After that it&#39;s really hard to ignore the Parks&#39; cruelty and selfishness. They use the poor and then discard them like they&#39;re barely human. Just like they fired their loyal workers that easily when the Kims framed them for things. All it took was one pair of underwear or a rumor from a man they barely knew, they didn&#39;t even look for proof or tried talking with the employees properly, they&#39;re just replaceable to them (one of them worked for their family for years if I recall). And of course they weren&#39;t aware of the man in the basement despite the signs. They were too self absorbed. <br>Basically, money and status affected all of the characters negatively, whether rich or poor, but the results for each group were different based on their wealth and status.",LandAhoy,2020-04-11T13:45:05Z,11
"LandAhoy Exactly! i’ve seen many people watch this and they only take away that the kims are parasites and the ‘bad guys’ that are leaching off the parks. but thats missing the whole point of the movie. although the parks never outright do something purposefully wrong or bad, all of their actions are done out of privilege, ignorance, and they are never worried about doing something wrong because they are the ones who hold authority over others (like the kims). This movie doesn’t have any villains but rather it just shows what class can do to people and a society.  To me, I cant get over the scene where ki-jeong has gotten stabbed and dasom fainted and the Park family and their friends dont even care but are just thinking of themselves, and the park family’s dad is just yelling for the keys so they can get out of there and they can help their son, while they’re employee is dying. And then when he plugs his nose, lifting up the body of the guy, and treating it like a worthless piece of garbage, truly it was disgusting just how little care they had for other peoples lives and that he still managed to look down upon them as they’re dying. <br>Also good point about the “not crossing the line” part!",karina,2020-04-11T01:36:05Z,16

"I think the movie is hugely misinterpreted by a lot of people - unfortunately as well in this video, although I liked it as food for thought. Parasite of course critiques modern society and decreasing social mobility. But it does not critique captialism per se. Parasite doesn&#39;t construct a class conflict, it instead shows (yes, like you said in your video) the ignorance of the rich for the struggles of the poor and the fighting between the poor to achieve the status of the rich. But it doesn&#39;t critique the system as well, it just shows that there is no way to move up in socioeconomic status. But there&#39;s an important distinction between critiquing this and constructing class conflict. Parasite shows the moral ambiguity of both, the Kims and the Parks, they&#39;re both Parasites to each other. The takeaway of the film is basically, that, within the system, the rich should be interested in enabling social mobility - of which the visual symbol of stairs is very present in the film - and open their eyes for the struggles of the poor in order to continue living their lifestyle. Because ultimately, the Parks pay the price for their ignorance - of course the Kims do as well. Both are losers of the increasing divide and the fight for a better socioeconomic status. I also think that this interpretation better fits the situation in South Korea as well as Bong Joon-ho&#39;s other work. (SPOILER) In Snowpiercer, for example, there is a big revolution at the end of the movie, the system is overthrown. But the result is, that the train derails and everybody dies at last. Everybody loses. We also have to interpret Bong&#39;s works with the current political landscape of South Korea in mind. Yes, there is a big divide between rich and poor, yes, there are no big safety nets for people like social systems in Europe (where I am from, btw). But there is also the very real negative example of a different economic system nearby: North Korea. Capitalism is engrained in South Korea and it is the main reason for the stellar rise of the country since the Korean War. Capitalism is not a bad &quot;ideology&quot; in South Korea, instead the current, negative development of capitalism proves dangerous for society, and this is what Parasite essentially critiques. Capitalism is neither bad nor good, it is essentially empty and what people make of it. South Korea has seen what good Capitalism can do, so Bongs Films would be far from critizising this very system and constructing a class conflict that any class can win and profit of.<br>I think Parasite is often misunderstood especially in countries like the US where there is a lack of social security systems or basic social democratic policy. But Parasite does not critique the system of capitalism itself, it does not pit two classes against each other, and when it does, it shows that no one can benefit from overthrowing the system or any sort of revolutionary act. At least that is my interpretation, and I personally think (of course I am biased) that I do have the arguments to support my interpretation here.",Crickethill,2020-03-01T12:38:27Z,0

"I like this film because it doesn’t really take sides — the Kims justify their heinous acts of social destruction that kill those equally impoverished and ultimately harms them as well by persuading themselves that only the rich can be just anyway, while the Parks are entirely oblivious and callous towards their plight, contributing as well to the tragedies that unfold. The smell could be a reflection of the miserable lives of the poor, but it may also be the stench of evil minds trying to take advantage of kindness. Another point I think could be raised is that maybe the Parks are nouveau rich themselves. Why would they know the smell of the subway and love the more “common” food of jjapaguri that isn’t really associated with the rich? Perhaps it’s showing how the rich are equally inelegant and lacking decorum deep down, but maybe it reflects how they managed to preserve their innocence as they climbed up from a much less affluent environment themselves, or maybe scarier yet, how this entire movie could be a cycle, meaning that the Kims could have acted just like the Parks if they climbed into their position, just as forgetful of their past. All in all, I feel the movie does a very nice job of illuminating both sides of the argument.",Wiwaxia Silver,2020-02-28T04:47:59Z,0

"Anybody notice in the movie, When the basement guy was tied up and pushed the botton with his head to send a message to Dasong while Dasong was in tent. Dasong tried to write down the message but he wrote nonsense words. This scene tells us that high class people can not understand lowerclass people words.. like there&#39;s a barrier between high and lower classes..",Park,2020-02-26T16:28:07Z,2204

"Nah, The boy always wanted to help the needy in some way,<br>In the first bunker basement scene, the old maid says she still texts Dasong (boy) and that is how she knew the Park’s were out camping. It is the boy who insisted to stay at the camp ground in the heavy rain because Dasong knew the old maid was going to retrieve some stuff at the house. When the Park’s had to leave the campsite Dasong insists on having Jjappaguri (ramdon) so the mom will call home in order to give heads up for the old maid to get out of the house. My two more cents on Dasong is that he represents the young generation of today who know the plea of the less fortunate people. Dasong sees the light flickering and sees the “HELP!” sent by the man in the basement. Like the young generation of this day Dasong does not have the money or the power to save such people. It is ironic because it is the young generation who feel such empathy but they do not have the means to save the poor. But when they have family of their own, they are too busy pursuing the American dream of capitalism.",vantestars,2020-05-02T05:49:01Z,35
"Tum Tum you would have a good point there if it weren&#39;t for the fact that the morse code used throughout the movie was actually s korean version of morse code and all of the messages were spelled out in korean. i believe the &quot;holp&quot; was just a translation used to get the point that he was spelling &quot;help me&quot; wrong across. but maybe i&#39;m wrong and english morse code was used in that scene, idk. i don&#39;t remember that particular scene well enough to be sure, but i do remember that every morse code guide shown on screen was written in the korean alphabet.",jace t,2020-04-24T22:56:44Z,11

"The sociological analysis starting at min 4 of your video is pretty good, however I would disagree with some of the assumptions. While it is important to raise issues of poverty and exploitation, I think its equally important to keep in mind the context, Korean society is much less meritocratic than western societies, throughout the film the director shows us just how capable the family acting as servants really are, often showing them as more capable than the Parks.  However,  the core issues in the U.S. and europe are not the same, while some capable people are certainly excluded from growth and wealth, the reasons for their exclusion have more to do with low labour mobility (i.e. the difficulty and cost of moving to cities where they could earn more) and the high cost of living in economically vibrant areas. With regards to Apple&#39;s exploitation of Foxconn factory workers I agree that bad working conditions should be corrected, but it is equally important to consider how literally millions of chinese farm workers went form struggling to feed themselves, to having access to education and opportunity, please read Factory girls, its a great account of the individuals we tend to look down on in the west, it shows just how creative, hard working, and ambitious these people are, and more importantly how these factory jobs enabled them to fulfil their dreams, and lead happier lives. To summarise: I agree with the overall gist of your argument, but I urge you to include more nuance and not use cliches to gloss over what are complex multi-factorial issues.",Luka taylor,2020-02-26T12:55:36Z,1
"Hey there, I agree. I had 30 followers when I made this video and never imagined it would be seen by such a wide audience. If I could go back, I would definitely make the video more culturally specific and contextualize the current situation in South Korea. In regards to the factories - I am aware that the advent of factory work has brought many of these people out of acute poverty, but there is still no excuse for why they are paid so little for the solid labour they do given what the people at the top are making. Unfortunately I squeezed these arguments into a video that was digestible for a mainstream audience, but if I could go back I would try and be more nuanced about it.",Broey Deschanel,2020-02-26T19:50:53Z,1

"If foolish politicians have been ruling the country with a brainless mind, ordinary people&#39;s lives would be getting darker like this realistic movie. And current South Korea lawmakers don&#39;t know what the citizens&#39; desire and happiness since they&#39;re so incompetent persons and they&#39;ve been seeking only their political benefits through their current position. Once, a few competent politicians had joined the political world of South Korea but they were kicked out by brainless and greedy politicians regardless of their party. Can&#39;t believe that? Nope...I said sad facts and I&#39;d say most Korean voters know it and they have had some hopeless situation, politically and economically.

Koro Muffin yes capitalism leads to the centralization of power and wealth that’s why at times of the cycle you have to smash up the monopolies to conserve capitalism not destroy the whole system. Communism fails because it’s solution to centralization is to centralize it even more. I just gave you everything you need to know between the two systems. I hope it changes your mind because greediness even if the intentions are pure can still lead to genocides even in America’s case but it was more or less just a conflict between cultures and all that.,JellyJam,2020-02-24T22:57:59Z,0

"Kevin I&#39;m sorry for my lateness but &quot;Rich Bad; Poor Good&quot; isn&#39;t the message of the movie, nowhere close. Never once does the movie endorse either side in which both sides are represented from the Parks and the Kims. Despite what your half-baked description of the theme states the Kims are not portrayed as good, and neither is the former houskeeper and her husband. The Kims literally commit murder so they can keep their own positions within the Park family. From how I took this movie, it was much more a message about the class divide which once again is represented by the two families, and how they react to one another&#39;s situations. <br><br><br>Also note; Just because someone criticizes the oh so glorious system of capitalism doesn&#39;t make the creator a marxist, just because people nominated this movie doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re marxist sympathizers. This film has literally nothing to do with the ideals of Karl Marx, nor did Marxism play any role in the decision to give this movie oscars. And being apolitical doesn&#39;t make a movie good, nor bad, it&#39;s about how the politics are represented and what the discussion is.",Grimlock852x,2020-04-03T04:14:31Z,13

"A basic flaw in the movie Parasite is that the poor family ( The Kims) is played by actors  who do not really appear poor, nor are the characters that they play appear poor. The actors seem well fed and clothed, with nice straight teeth , groomed hair and manners,and appear educated. The  various characters that they play can apparently speak English, are computer literate to the point where they can forge documents , can pass as a psychological therapist, and can keep and maintain a modern household. In this sense the movie does a disservice to many poor people who cannot so easily &quot;fake &quot; upper class social  and educational skills.skills and",M Good6591,2020-02-24T00:12:43Z,0

"Well done. Needed more so than ever! Cool capitalism started, as far as I am concerned, when we all started wearing T shirts with the logos of companies considered cool, back in the &#39;70&#39;s, the rise of maga manufacturers. We may not be able to afford the products but we can consider ourselves cool by being walking billboards for such companies. How much is Parasite about, &#39;survival of the fitess?&#39; No revolution shown, but what is the definition of revolution, blood is let and people are killed. In Western countries inequality is obvious if people chose to see it! Governments refuse to see it, in Canada PM, in a photo op, gives out winter coats to refugees but nothing to Canadians sleeping on concrete in major Canadian cities during the heat of the summer or freezing cool of winter. In former third world countries, you have the rich living in highrise apartments and people living in carboard boxes as neighbours. A contrast that say we don&#39;t all rise together. This comparison is becoming more so in the West. A couple of decades ago the thought was, the distance of standard of living  between the first world countries and the third world was getting wider. Now the distances within each country between the haves and the have nots is getting wider and wider.",Boston Blackie,2020-02-23T18:21:52Z,0

That&#39;s the point of the movie. The makers think that this is the class system that is embedded so deep in the society that families like these can do nothing to get out of their basement apartments. And the Parks are as oblivious as the makers expect them to be much like real life. That is the reason why the movie ends in a negative note with the kims getting nowhere and the Parks being destroyed due to their unawareness of the working class in their own home.,Saee Walkikar,2020-03-29T05:29:13Z,0

"Parasite is a hopelessly naive and simplistic movie. The so-called &quot;elite&quot; class is not monolithic. It is heavily stratified with constant movement, conflict and - more often than people are willing to admit - violence at the interfaces. If this were anything approaching reality the rich family would be as concerned with holding on to their position and/or attempting to ascend the next rung of the ladder as the poor one. I&#39;m not sure how much you have read of people like Gramsci but given the context into which you&#39;ve embedded the quote I question whether you&#39;ve understood any it. I see you have quoted Doug Kellner who I know from way back in Austin (before he came to the conclusion that if you can&#39;t beat them - join them). Unless he has changed a great deal since he became all &quot;civilised&quot; I&#39;d argue he&#39;d take a rather jaundiced view of Bong - who affects to be a critical observer outside the socio-political framework but whether he understands it or not (&quot;We allow you to make the films in which you say what you like <b>BECAUSE</b> we like what you say&quot;) in his attempts to undermine societal norms he simply re-enforces them.<br><br><br>I mean, faced with being returned to a &quot;free&quot; but precivilised age as his protagonists are at the end of Snowpiercer after they overthrow the tyranny of the train most people living today (who could scarcely survive twenty four hours in nature no matter how many episodes of Bear Grylls they&#39;ve watched) wouldn&#39;t think twice about leaving - regardless of their miserable existence. And yet Bong is presenting a completely bogus false dichotomy which some might argue serves little purpose but to prop up the status quo. <br><br>By the way - with the exception of a half-a-dozen families whose heritage can be traced all the way back to the Crusades just about everyone in the elite class at some point began scratching out a living at the very bottom rungs of the ladder.  This pathway has always existed - and it always shall. Indeed in countries such as the United States, Britain and France sufficiently talented members of the working class are feted and recruited (usually within the University/High School system) and fast-tracked into positions of responsibility (think of Richard Nixon or John Major). Contrary to your argument it has <b>never</b> been difficult to accrue wealth. It&#39;s comforting to pin the blame entirely on the upper elites for conspiring at every turn to thwart progress toward the wealth and happiness you unquestionably deserve when the reality is you chose not to pursue this end because the cost was too high. When I say &quot;cost&quot; I&#39;m not talking about enthusiasm, labour or money. I&#39;m talking about the cost to your humanity - or to use religious terminology - your immortal soul. And once you step over that line there&#39;s no going back. &quot;Successful&quot; people have the capacity to compartmentalise this cost and continue to function. But most people can&#39;t. There have been many opportunities in my life when I have turned down opportunities to make a great deal more money because I knew I couldn&#39;t live with the memory of screwing people over.

"&quot;In a capitalist society the prevailing conservative argument is that social democracy, higher taxes, and budget deficits take from the rich and give to the lazy&quot; Wrong. That is not the conservative argument atall and if liberals and Democrats would actually listen to the &quot;prevailing conservative argument &quot; which they&#39;ve always ignored they would know the real conservatives see certainly in the case of higher taxes that, that is theft from not only the rich but form everyone rich, middle class and the poor which never betters the class gap but deepens it while less government, indavidual achievement and yes hard work gets you to higher levels of success.  You are in effect under a capitalist system a self made person. Under socialism this is a near impossibility because everything under socialism is deincentive to getting out of poverty.  The government is so big under socialism that it treats everyone the same and takes from people the means to be a indavidual success and make money because the government is always slapping you down to keep you in equal standing with the rest of the working class. In other words. Its slavery without the chains .A good socialist becomes their own slave masters and becomes imprisoned by their ideology instead of good old fashioned common sense .",FRAUD SQUAD,2020-02-21T15:49:16Z,0

"This is a weird interpretation of Parasite.  There are very few Marxists in SKorea.  I doubt the director was thinking along the line of the Marxist interpretation of this film as Broey Deschanel suggests.  Bong was probably thinking of something more practical and mundane as the fact that in Korea, particularly in Seoul, young people cannot hope to ever own their own homes, making it difficult for them to marry, have kids, and have a family.  Also, what is missing in the subtitle translation is the fact that Korean is a polite language.  This is an aspect of the movie translation that&#39;s gone totally missing.  In polite languages such as Korean and Japanese, language presupposes a whole host of social expectations.  In the subtitle translation, this aspect of social expectation is totally lost, as there&#39;s no such equivalency in the English language.  When watching the movie in Korean, it is Mr. Park&#39;s family who dare not &quot;cross the line.&quot;  Mr. Park&#39;s entire family shows proper respect for Mr. Kim&#39;s family members (in Korean).  What is happening in a consumer-oriented society, this traditional value of basic human decency is increasingly becoming blurred.",jeansdude,2020-02-20T23:26:04Z,0

"This movie is more about members of the working class fighting each other instead of working together. When I thought the movie was about rich vs poor, I didn&#39;t like it because it didn&#39;t make much sense. The Kim family is not likable at all. They&#39;re lazy (25% defect rate folding pizza boxes) and heartless. They get the chauffeur and housekeeper fired with little remorse. They don&#39;t care that they left the housekeeper for dead in the basement. When I thought this was rich vs poor class warfare it didn&#39;t make sense because the poor are pictured in such a terrible light. But when you see it more as the cruelty of the poor towards each other in their fright for scraps from the rich, it makes more sense. And yes, this is very much a Marxist movie that urges the working class to unite instead of fighting each other.",GizmoMaltese,2020-02-20T21:10:05Z,405

Despite both son and father both having at least driver and English experience. The idea that the mother and daughter had less humanity and are much more quicker to assimilate into the higher class speaks more on the idea that the poor people who are actually able to rise and benefit from the flawed system are also the ones most of aware of the injustices it causes people like them.

"@Jared G. did you watch the movie? Because it seems that you missed up the point entirely.<br>I don&#39;t know how you would get from the movie that the people didn&#39;t want to work hard to get a better life. <br>With the sister, she had the talent and she could teach, but being she didn&#39;t have the connections or the money to get a chance. Neither did the brother, who did very well in school but cannot go to university. The kids they were tutoring were just born into wealth the same way they were born into poverty. And so by random luck one set of kids have access to the best schools (he can pay the fees or he could literally pay their way in or they could get a leg up in applications if their parents are important enough or donate enough money to the school) and tutors and resources. If they want an internship their dad can connect them and they can afford to work it unpaid, if they want to start a business he can lend them a few million dollars or probably has good credit. They can get the right clothes to impress at an interview, they were probably able to prep or have powerful connected people to represent them. They know all the unwritten laws about how to behave in corporate spaces.<br>And if you start a business venture how are you going to make a million? Someone has to be able to work for you, right? Someone has to be the maid cleaning or the security guard otherwise you&#39;d never increase in scale enough to drag yourself out of your social class. And should those people then live miserably and be disadvantaged in most areas of life? Why is their (the kids in the movie) ability to participate in the so-called meritocracy hindered?<br>These are the questions Parasite invites us to ask.<br>Everyone loves a good story about someone making it big but it is incredibly naive to think that all you need to succeed is willpower and work ethic. It&#39;s a start and a crucial part of it BUT being wealthy or having a wealthy background gives an unimaginable boost to our aspirations.

Maybe starting your own business venture or investing for example. Think of it like a car and a rocket ship. You&#39;re saying that a car should be able to get you to space when it actually has no business doing that. A rocket ship will, however, get you to space. But, they&#39;re much riskier and harder to build. You&#39;re expecting someone to carry you to space in a car, even though you didn&#39;t wanna put in the work and risk everything to build a rocket ship.

"The characters are acting not even logical...They are so talented, they could be wealthy in no time, as all of them are clever, eager to work and presentable. Instead, they are setting in the basement folding pizza cartons. They are completely wasting their capital and living in their self-made poverty. The men in the basement dude could have just worked off his debt. There is no need to live in the basement. In general, he is completely overacting all the time and his character feels like a spin-off of overly-emotional theatre actor and not a realistic poor worker. I don`t get how this can be seen as meaningful criticism. Every person who is acting selfish and arrogant is poor. And they are not even forced to be egocentric. That`s just the way the are. Lazy and reckless. The rich people are by far the most moral advanced in the movie. And: When does it rain that much in Korea? Pretty weird to celebrate that movie as a profound social commentary.

"This review is so rife with imposition of the reviewer&#39;s own biases and a priori assumptions that it truly astonished me. Wow. The poor family&#39;s &quot;harsh society?&quot; There&#39;s nothing in the film to suggest that the society they live in is harsh, though what is established early on is that the poor family has entrenched itself in poverty by the choices they relate and demonstrate, including laziness, dishonesty, lack of perseverance, lack of respect for others, and willful lack of education, etc, even praising the daughter&#39;s cleverness such that she&#39;d make a great con artist.  It&#39;s simply not established in the film that they are victims of anything but their own devices: Right out of the gate the poor father relates how many jobs he&#39;s had, been unwilling to keep, and so apparently maintained his family&#39;s poverty, as well as what he has modeled for his children who repeat the pattern. As the father later says, he doesn&#39;t have a plan because plans go wrong, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy.  Or what about another of the reviewer&#39;s impositions: The Park family is leeching off of the poor people too?! How? By hiring them to perform a service and paying them to do it? (Is this reviewer leeching off of YouTube?) My gosh, talk about imposition of snobbish, elitist assumptions external to the film and then, as sure as the sun will rise, proffering her clear preference for socialism supported by a vapid critique of capitalism that affirms the subtext of her review. Truly mind-boggling this review.  Sorry, but the reviewer&#39;s assessment is &quot;not on the page.&quot;",Flyoverland,2020-02-17T04:59:07Z,0

"I thought it was interesting how the family living in the sub-basement still see themselves as superior to the family living in the basement (like the father blaming the man for living there without a plan while he himself famously never makes a plan). Is that a reference to people considering themselves middle class while the middle class has been collapsing for years into lower class? From the interior of the sub-basement one would think they were not always a poor family, despite the father being constantly compared to a bug.<br>Another two interesting points that I saw in another video: the cinematography often uses physical lines (glass panes, corners of the room, and other architectural elements) to visually seperate the Park&#39;s from their servants. Watch it again and it&#39;s hard to miss. Also, I found it very interesting that somebody mentioned the little boy&#39;s obsession with Native Americans. Could this be a reference to how the Park family is completely oblivious to those scheming to invade their territory?<br><br><br>This movie has so many layers, it will occupy my mind for a while. Although it did bother me that at times the social commentary seemed to overrule common sense. Like how when the rich parents lay down on the couch and the poor family is hiding under the table, he smells the father rather than all the bottles of alcohol they broke half an hour earlier. And the plan at the end might seem like a wonderful way of conveying the broken American dream, but wouldn&#39;t he just go and help his father escape the next night rather than going through some outlandish and abstract plan?",SomeRandomGuy164,2020-02-16T23:20:51Z,6

I feel empty sometimes when I think about it. I think that&#39;s why a lot of people like to ignore it, because it makes you feel so helpless, but you can only ignore it when you have a certain level of privelege and wealth. When you aren&#39;t forced to experience it.

"Well good video, but the thing is, in an interview Bong Joon-ho literally said &quot; if you say that the poor family is the parasite you wouldn&#39;t be wrong&quot; and then explained why the rich family could be considered parasites as well. So basically he&#39;s saying everyone in this movie is a parasite. So I think you kinda misunderstood what the director wanted to say at some point since he clarified that. I also heard that he regret not calling the movie &quot;parasites&quot; instead of parasite so that makes even more sense. No problem with that anyway. At the end it&#39;s a really symbolic movie so of course people will reach different conclusions.

"I mean, Foxconn is contracted by many other tech giants to build their products too, to focus solely on Apple is a moot point. I have relatives that live in Hong Kong, who were up in Shenzhen to work at those factory campuses. The socioeconomic condition means that they believe the work they endure is a fact of life. It is highly exaggerated by the west of being close to &#39;slave labour&#39; when the skill level of work is relative to how they are paid. A lot of the western criticism does not take into consideration that standard of living and affordability is very different to the west and people live in relative comfort, not so concerned about being &#39;in poverty&#39;. The scandals at Foxconn only picked up and escalated in the media when locals started to pick up that the conditions were not to a &#39;western standard&#39; and workers started to develop mental health symptoms by way of exposure. As an inductive example, one of my cousins that worked at the campus that focused mainly on Microsoft products like keyboards and mice, saved enough to travel a bit with his girlfriend. This was his first time going overseas, and to Australia in fact. He returned, and couldn&#39;t last in the same job for more than two months and started developing symptoms of depression shortly after. The other cousin was actually stationed at one of the Foxconn factories that assembled for Apple. I used to remember him complaining about some of his fellow workers would slack off and hold up their entire line and get hated on by that whole team. You don&#39;t hear anything about about these things in the west. It&#39;s more local media stuff. The west is focused on pushing class-warfare, and profiting from the lower, middle-class outrage. Anyway, my cousin stayed there for about 3 years and got promoted to supervisor and is now a line manager. I guess the first example was similar to how the Kims were generally content with their living arrangement, until they were given a glimpse of the outside, their mentality of class had shifted, it&#39;s as though they cannot go back. The Parks were ignorant, while the Kims were hyperaware of this class divide.",Jacky Fan,2020-02-13T03:48:47Z,0

"Thank you for presenting a clear overview of the film &amp; the social commentary. As a person of Asian descent, I have to add that class system has been our story for many, many generations. And when things got crazy in Old China, at the turn of 1900’s, finally it took a group of radical rebels, to kick out all the corrupt foreign businessmen &amp; annihilate the upper class aristocracy. Then they introduced communist party, where all people were equal as employees of government. It also meant, the government regimented every aspect of ones life, no detail too big or too small. It was like 1984. No ideas or expression was allowed except what was in the red book. Even words were regimented. ~ After awhile, Red China opened its doors again, to do business with the world. ~ And, it seems, the cycle just keeps repeating itself. ~ However, I suggest a little less greed &amp; corruption at the top, and really allow more people at the bottom to participate in a fair market society, where the majority can live well ..

I thought the film was masterfully made and very funny but its marxist theme is nothing new and morally flawed. The director skillfully makes the viewer feel symphony for this poor family. But there actions are far more evil than anything the rich family did. The poor family are con artists who commit murder. The only moral flaw of the rich family shown is there indifference to the plight of the poor. We really don&#39;t know how the father became successful...was that explained? If he were a gangster or a corrupt business man then the title parasite would be earned. I found this to be a major flaw in the film. Also the heavy handed symbolism was just over the top at times.,Dan the man,2020-02-12T20:21:17Z,1

"I&#39;d like to add some thing myself <br>They might be far fetched but this movie gives us a lot of space to do so. <br>1) Regarding the rich mother falling asleep in two random moments. This might be a mocking because she does nothing and still falls asleep, while the working class is tired so people fall asleep from lack of it or she is so bored she has nothing to do, that she falls asleep again in contrary to others that have too much to do and thus get exhausted. <br>2) Again this might be far fetched but it&#39;s just my point of view. The man in the basement, the one that has been there for 4 years is a very good representation of North Korea. He lives so close to the rich ones, yet they don&#39;t know him at all because he is hidden there, far from the rest of the world. He is eating barely enough to survive yet still feels thankful for Mr. Park who is &#39;feeding&#39; him yet Mr. Park doesn&#39;t even know him. His life&#39;s purpose is to do use light patterns as an ode to his greatness. The fact that his wife did a news reporter from N.Korea and did it so well, according to him, further proves those two are connected. <br>3) The main character (the poor son) is eventually most of us. Capitalism promises that by hard work, everyone will be able to succeed. Just like the rest of us, he wants to work well and make money, to get his dad out of there. To &#39;raise&#39; him, from the basement to the top. We all want a better future for our parents, to please them for everything they&#39;ve given us. Especially in Korea, as far as I know, kids tend to be close with their parents even when they get older. However, the son never makes it. His son won&#39;t make it as well. and so on and so on. Unlike Capitalism&#39;s promise, it&#39;s a state that can hardly change. <br>4) The boundaries about the rich father what talking about. It gives me goosebumbs to think that he said something along the lines of &#39;Mr Kim has been close to crossing the line but never does so&#39; yet at the end of the movie he does, comes really close to him, in the most aggressive way possible. What a masterpiece this movie was!",jimin's thighs rap mon's dimples,2020-02-12T13:03:23Z,213

"The only thing I would object is your example regarding how the lightness of your skintone measure the attractiveness because of the eurocentric world hence consumers buy lightening products. Most consumers from these products are from Asia, and we buy them not because we want to be &#39;White&#39;, never from that race, but looking paler has been a traditional belief that you are a noble, attractive and rich since you don&#39;t go outside to work under the sun.",phantasmagoria,2020-02-12T08:17:06Z,3

I wonder how this unfairness of life will ever get to be addressed in the afterlife.

"One detail that people missed in this film is the fact that Mr. Kim (father) at one point was an employee of Mr. Geun-sae (man living in the bunker). In the first half of the film, there is a scene where the Kim family is having lunch at a driver&#39;s cafe and Jessica (daughter) asks her father if he ever got to drive Mercedes-Benz vehicles during his occupation as a driver. Mr. Kim then revealed that he never did get to drive Mercedes-Benz cars until he began his job as a valet driver. He also revealed that he found his valet job after working at a Taiwan cake shop that went bust. In the second half of the film when it was revealed that Gook-moon gwang (former housekeeper) was harboring her husband in the hidden bunker, her husband reveals that his Taiwan cake shop went bust and he had to turn to loan sharks to try to save his business which led to him being indebted and hiding from those debt collectors.",Vag Pounder,2020-02-12T06:25:07Z,2768
"No. Ki-Taek didn’t work for Geun-Se. They both started their own businesses when the Taiwan Cake boom started in Korea in 2016, and they both went down when a tv program falsely claimed that the cakes contained ingredients harmful to consumers and everyone started boycotting the cakes.<br>Ki-Taek made that face while hiding in the stairs because he shared the same experience. He felt a mix of empathy for the man, a relief that he didn’t end up like him, and also fear that he could’ve easily ended up like Geun-Se if he wasn’t as lucky.<br>It’s one of those details that Korean audiences could catch on instantly, but it wasn’t important enough for the plot that it didn’t change the interpretation of story for foreign audiences.",Daniel Kim,2020-03-06T07:15:29Z,4

"Some spoilers I guess. The way people excuse the actions of the poor family in this film blows my mind. They cause all the problems in the film and are the antagonists, not protagonists. They get 2 cushy high paying jobs with no real issues then start scheming and fucking over other lower class people even going so far as to fuck with some woman&#39;s serious allergies?? Then it gets even worse, and the whole excuse is &quot;oh but they are poor, therefore exploited, therefore all the murders and ethically despicable shit they do is just fine.&quot; The rich people are not saints, profiting off the poor in a shitty system but seriously.. The daughter saves the poor son&#39;s life while his family is in the process of killing hers. No one thinks that&#39;s fucked up? IDK if the director predicted this, but maybe he&#39;s trying to expose some ethical collapse in our society caused by poverty. That&#39;s what this video and many comments about this movie look like to me. Like &quot;good&quot; ending was so much shittier than the real ending.

"Hi everyone! Wow thank you so much for all the kind comments it&#39;s really cool to see people engaging with the video :) I just wanted to address two things: 1) I apologize if my skin whitening example came off as Eurocentric. I should have acknowledged that the aspiration for paleness in certain places has deep historical/cultural roots. However, I used that example because the desire for whiter skin is not just limited to East Asia, and there is no way that this can be divorced from a long history of colonialism that has impacted so many cultures around the world - not to mention contemporary beauty standards promoted through global mass media. I myself am half Guyanese, and the colourism that exists in our culture is historical, but it is also very much entangled with Eurocentrism.  2) Many people have argued that capitalism is at least better than its alternative: communism. I never once mentioned communism in this video and I made an effort to specify that I&#39;m talking about neoliberal/late capitalism. I (personally) believe more government intervention and a more robust social safety net is a viable answer to an untethered and deregulated free market system.

"East asian aspiration for whitness is not eurocentric; it&#39;s based in their own cultures valuing of paleness. That does not mean to say that it is good, rather that defining it as eurocenterism is evidence of your own eurocenterism. Also, to put so much emphasis on &quot;late stage capitalism&quot; is a bit dishonest when that culture (either South Korean or modern American) derives from an even more hierarchal system with far less economic mobility (more so in Korea than the U.S.A.).

The colourism that exists in my culture/family has deep historical roots, but it is also very much entangled with a long history of colonialism and contemporary beauty standards. In addition, skin whitening does not just occur in Asia. As to your second critique, I am making an analysis based on what Bong presented to us in his movie - whether the nihilistic ending was for theatrical purposes or not.

Of course, modern capitalism combines some elements of socialism as well through provision of various welfare benefits and other devices that act to more evenly level the playing field and soften the lower edge of society. However, social inequality will always remain, because we are all born unequally. What&#39;s also meaningful about this movie is that there is no real antagonist. It&#39;s not overtly a movie about the lower class revolting against the rich upper class. If anyone feels the movie was about that, that&#39;s a misunderstanding of the movie.

"While I respect your opinion on capitalism, I have to disagree. Your analysis was very thorough and thought provoking ,and you make some excellent points. However it’s been proven throughout history time and time again that communist countries have killed millions upon millions .  Communist  usually once in power throw away all pretending personas of serving the poor, and begin to pocket the wealth of the needy. While I don’t believe capitalism is perfect by any means, I think it’s the best thing we have right now. I think parasite points out many flaws in the system, however South Korea is a capitalist country ,on the border with a deeply communist dictatorship to the north.  So in this instance I don’t think the film is inherently anti capitalist, but simply pointing out many of its flaws",Kenshiro,2020-02-09T18:54:08Z,1

"While I loved the film, I don&#39;t particularly like how everyone is tearing into the very core of capitalism as if it isn&#39;t actually more beneficial to society as, lets say, communism. But while I feel strongly about that, that is not to say that capitalism doesn&#39;t triumph over communism in SOME of the worst ways; and that being harsh status difference that separates the rich from the poor. Most middle class people are likely to stay at their staus, but have a chance at becoming rich, while having a slim chance of landing in poverty, while most impoverished people are stuck. I feel like this movie did highlight why the impoverished suffer from being so stagnant, because while they may be skilled, their inability to afford school or (mostly) college can leave them where they are until someone along the line breaks off from the chain. <br><br>But again, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s black and white. Capitalism isn&#39;t inherently evil, but I don&#39;t believe there is such a thing as a perfect system either. Again though, as much as I am for capitalism, I feel like this movie did such a good job at pointing at many facets of economic status in society. Like, while there may not have been a middle class family in the mix, I do believe that Min, the friend who gave Ki-woo that tutoring job,  may have been the representation for that. I think it&#39;s safe to assume that he was that &#39;path&#39; for Ki-woo to reach higher, because as most middle class people, he has the opportunity to either stay where he is or become richer, and in this case he granted his friends entire family the chance to become higher just because of something simple as posing as a college tutor, which Ki-woo probably couldn&#39;t get into for whatever reasons (and this is just an assumption, but I&#39;m pretty sure that most colleges in Korea (I think) deeply scrutinize what school you came from to determine if you should be a student at their college. But feel free to correct me if I&#39;m wrong, I just often hear drama about &quot;you want to go to that school?! Won&#39;t college be hard to get into?&quot; kinda stuff.)",Phibie,2020-02-08T22:05:54Z,7

"The funniest part of the movie for me is how the rich are assumed to be higher-up in terms of social darwinism, how you&#39;re trained to just assume that they&#39;re simply better people who deserve their positions and that they&#39;re definitely better and put in more labor than the lazy poor people, but in actuality it is the poor family that both out-labors the rich and out-smarts them. The poor are the alphas, the rich are the betas, and if their economic roles were reversed the Parks would probably starve in the streets.<br>I know a person who&#39;s deeply indoctrinated into the Capitalist mindset. It is never the fault of the corporation, or the business, it&#39;s always either the government or poor people, expect when the government helps the rich, then it&#39;s fine, but if it even thinks of helping the poor riots should break out in the streets. I know it should terrify me, but the fact that this person wouldn&#39;t get even a whiff of this message is hilarious to me. They are the basement dweller that&#39;s bashing their brains in like a trained dog in a vain attempt to please their superior, who they only assume is superior due to their status.<br>The movie&#39;s tone might change in the second half, but in a certain sense, it&#39;s still a comedy trough and trough.",Peasham,2020-02-08T17:24:43Z,71

"In my opinion  &quot;Parasite&quot; is one of the best movies in the last decade, and this analysis is simply brilliant, I agree 100% that every class lives through expenses of the other and what I loved the most is that the director neither idealize the Kim&#39;s nor condemn the Parks, is a very objective view with characters that have both virtues and defaults like real human beings, thank you so much for this contribution, however I think blaming capitalism per se for some of the problems the film points out is too symplistic and I don&#39;t see that&#39;s Bong Jo&#39;s intention. There are a lot of things that are not desirable in modern society however I have to ask this: what economic system is a better alternative ?? Socialism also has an upper class gathered in the dominant party. Myself as an inhabitant from a latin american country where state interventionism is still very strong I can tell you that politics which are oriented to a socialist model are everything but succesfull in order to improve people&#39;s lives, my dad grew up in a country without foreign companies around, without free market awareness and again in a land ruled by strong statism policies... he was miserable, he literally spent all his childhood living in a paperboard house and eating only twice a day, he had to  do all type of minor services by himself to afford his school and finally after many years of struggle he was in a much better situation however during his productive years there weren&#39;t many opportunities unless you were a friend of a politician, that was before we were &quot;invaded&quot; by neoliberalist policies.  There will always be better-paid jobs than others, simply because we as a society value unique talent more than low-skilled labor, I mean I agree we should be awared about social injustice and we can do a lot more to close the barriers but  I&#39;ve worked in the filming industry and in a production even if it&#39;s small there are hundreds of people involved and I&#39;m sure Mr. Bong Joon Ho has no remorse of him or his main actors earning more money than those others who had a lesser role by making his films besides he lives in a world where he doesn&#39;t have to be part of the top 1000 billionaires to enjoy a very decent level of life.  It&#39;s the way it is, as Churchill said: &quot;capitalism is the worst system except all others&quot;",joseafalvel,2020-02-07T04:20:26Z,50
"There are more choices than communism and high-inequality corporatism. The problems in the movie were how poor the Kims are, how difficult it is to escape poverty despite opening businesses like the cake shop, that 500 university graduates apply to be a security guard, etc. You can solve these without the USSR.<br><br>Scandinavian social-welfare capitalism ensures it&#39;s easier to work your way up and the poorest live better lives. More people can afford university, your life isn&#39;t ruined if your business goes bust, and it&#39;s easier to be an entrepreneur who gives other people jobs.",WaveHello,2020-02-25T02:58:37Z,1

"Excellent analysis! When are the world’s societies going to finally realize that we’re living in a capitalistic illusion? I believe that a better economic system exists and it’s not necessarily total socialism. The only reason we aren’t doing anything about it yet is because the top 10% IS the (corrupt) government and/or their friends. Sadly, the cruel way our society is operating is beneficial to those people. Why would they want to change it?

Bong was  just one of them although most sophisticated. But after watched your review I consiered this film might be waaay better than it&#39;s similar theme cousin &quot;Snow piercer&quot; and maybe mr. Bong is a real thing.

What the point of the money and all the car but ur not happy or dont have anyone to enjoy it with.  Family is the most important part of everything mayb we are our own PARASITES to our selfs.

"Excellent! What insightful analysis and thorough research! There&#39;s one thought I wanted to express, though: I feel like the cultural hegemony that the Kims have bought into has less to do with worshiping the upper class (I would argue that they look down on the Parks, and see them as nice but foolish) and more to do with their own pride. They&#39;ve had a taste of what it&#39;s like to have status and money, and now they will not let go of it, no matter what. Even if it means killing fellow workers, they will keep climbing the &quot;social staircase&quot; (notice the visual metaphor in the film of the two families racing to the top of the bunker stairs, dragging each other down). In this sense, I believe capitalism has taught them not to be content with servitude, but to claw their way to the top.<br><br>I actually am writing a paper on this as my college integrative project (incorporating Marx and Rousseau), so it&#39;s definitely good to see other folks doing their research and finding the deeper meanings behind Parasite! What a fantastic film, truly. I will check out the sources you quoted and see if I can incorporate them in my bibliography.",Rachelle Savard,2020-02-04T03:03:52Z,63
"@Broey Deschanel Oh yes definitely there is a bit of a love-hate dynamic going on between  the two families. The Kims believe themselves to be better than the Parks on some level, because they are smarter, or at least more wily. On the other hand, they are jealous of the Parks&#39; wealth and status. They&#39;ve seen the privileged lifestyle of this bourgeois family and want it for themselves. This is what leads the Kims to thinking of the house as &quot;their house,&quot; even though it will never actually be theirs. They feel entitled to it because they are starting to believe they can integrate into the world of the Parks (through the means of Kiwoo marrying Dahye). So on some level they hate these snobby rich people. But they also want to be them, as we see with Kiwoo&#39;s fantasy at the end. No matter what, money always corrupts. Even though the poor may despise the rich, they still desire that lifestyle for themselves (which is hypocritical of course, but very human).",Rachelle Savard,2020-02-05T21:50:26Z,4
"That&#39;s a great interpretation, perhaps that&#39;s truly what&#39;s going on here. Would you say it&#39;s a mixture of pride (pitying the Parks) and idolizing them to the extent that they want to become them (not because they think they&#39;re better by any means)?

IN CONCLUSION COMMUNISM !!!,Luna Bautista,2020-02-03T18:57:54Z,1
"First, I would like to say wow, this analysis took a lot of time and research which is highly commendable. However, because you are analyzing this movie from a very limited framework, you have missed out on the overall theme of this movie which isn&#39;t about capitalism, though it does play a part in it. It&#39;s easy to get stuck in this black and white mindset where society is constructed to keep rich people at the top and poor people at the bottom. Rich people are simply benefiting from a capitalistic system and poor people can never rise to the top. This simply isn&#39;t factually true. If you took less time looking over theories and more time looking at the research data you would see that the facts point to a different narrative. For example, intelligence is a bigger factor of success than socio economic status. In other words, a rich person born in poverty has a higher chance of becoming richer than a person of lesser intelligence born in wealth. There seems to be a wide variety of factors and there still needs to be more research. However, from what we do know, there are a few components that are seemingly crucial. One, you need to have emotional intelligence in order to take risks such as starting your own business. That means, having a stable supportive social support network so when you fail, you can keep going and learning from your mistakes. Not having a stable emotional support group as well as a poor emotional well being will greatly stifle your ability to do well. Second, you need to have the right personality. People who are open, disagreeable, and conscientious tends to make more money than those who aren&#39;t. In order words, you need to have an entrepreneurial mindset in order to attain a lot of wealth. If you are interested in studying and helping people instead of making money, then you won&#39;t make a lot of money because that isn&#39;t your goal. And of course, intelligence is probably the biggest predictor of wealth and unfortunately, this disadvantage is not socially constructed but naturally imposed. So in the end, yes, there is a clear inequality between rich and poor in modern capitalistic societies such as America but it seems to be inherited in natural injustices rather than socially constructed injustices. But even if you aren&#39;t intelligent, nor have the right personality to break into the 1%, it doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t live a comfortable and happy life because you don&#39;t need to smart or rich to be happy and happiness is a better end to strive for.",k,2020-02-03T18:25:32Z,2
"I would have to disagree. Just because someone is intelligent does not guarantee they can climb the socio-economic ladder. You can see it in the film itself - Ki-Woo and Ki-Jeung are shown to be highly skilled and intelligent individuals, but neither of them is able to escape their socioeconomic situation. They stand in complete opposition to someone like (forgive me) Donald Trump, who is by no means an objectively intelligent individual, yet who amassed an empire based on economic status and connections alone. There are always external factors at play - did you parents have time to support and encourage your education? are you able to afford a better education? does your school have the resources/funding to provide adequate learning? does your government offer adequate funding? do you have to forgo your ambitions to take care of relatives? All of these combine to disadvantage someone from attaining higher socioeconomic status - wealth cannot be equated to innate biological qualities. Of course it&#39;s a socially constructed injustice, economic wealth itself is a manmade thing.",Broey Deschanel,2020-02-03T21:15:21Z,4

"Awesome interpretation. What I love about this film is that the wealthy society, which percieves itself to be cutoff from the impoverished, actually depends upon their labor.

"Thoughtful video that engages with the ideas and theories with great enthusiasm. I always enjoy these. Well edited, well argued. Brisk pace and gets large concepts across in an efficient way. This movie was terrific.<br><br>Let&#39;s go on a trip together. There&#39;s a number of things that prevented me from buying into an anlysis of this movie that is primarily sociological or economic. One is, if killing Mr. Park was a justifiable action according to this video&#39;s thesis, i.e. the wrongful oppression of many through cool capitalism and cultural hegemony which should be defied, how do we explain Mr. Kim&#39;s remorse and shellshock afterward? <br><br>There&#39;s a hint of Crime and Punishment in here which brings the movie beyond economic and sociological interpretation. Namely the individual psychology and personal struggle with aforementioned structures, cool capitalism, cultural hegemony, and with murder, personal corruption, exploitation of others, etc. Mr. Kim&#39;s human reaction to murder goes beyond economic and cultural analysis. The mere fact of being human confounds rational justifications. If cool capitalism and cultural hegemony are so wrong and deserve to be rebelled against, then why doesn&#39;t Mr. Kim revel in his victory? Because life is so much deeper than economic or sociological analyses. And I think, despite Bong&#39;s overt interpretations of his own film, that this movie argues that point at its core.<br><br>While I agree that there is a fearsome takeaway from this movie, I don&#39;t think the emphasis is placed on theoretical structures. Those things are pervasive in the movie and certainly frame it, but they take a backseat to the characters and the importance of personal conduct in the face of economic or social circumstances.<br><br>The movie contains, oddly, an archetypal hero myth structure in the falling action. The hero rescues his father from the underground, or at least aspires to do so. This is a reference to the power of the individual and how he can rejuvenate society by upright action. This points to a significant shift in Kevin&#39;s personality that suggests, retroactively, that the movie was foremost about Kevin&#39;s psychological journey and personal development, rather than an explication of economic and sociological concepts. I won&#39;t go into any great depth about this line of argumentation because of the limits of this format.

"@elliphant21 <br><br>Korea&#39;s economic situation is nothing short of a disaster. So shortly after its miraculous rise in wealth, it is now projected to enter permanent economic recession similar to Japan. Corruption plays a big role, as well as an aging demography and overdependance upon international trade. Nothing you&#39;ve brought up is false. Kiwoo may never be able to realize his explicit noble aspiration. In fact, he most certainly won&#39;t.<br><br>That lies outside my argument, however. I did not say he would be able to rescue his father. I said that he had experienced a personality shift that, maybe for the first time in his life, has lifted his eyes UP, changed his target to one that rises UP. There are many small steps to take, and along that steep and difficult path upwards, there is potential for personality growth and psychological development.<br><br>I&#39;ll repeat my point. The economic analysis which you&#39;ve put forward does not fully encompass Kiwoo&#39;s humanity. It&#39;s a cliche, but it rings true here: money does not buy happiness. Marcus Aurelius wrote, &quot;the happiness of your life depends on the quality of your thoughts.&quot; Kiwoo&#39;s thoughts--more, his entire perspective--has changed and put him on an upward trajectory. Again, upward in terms of his character and personal development. This brings in the symbol in the movie, the scholar&#39;s rock. Does it represent wealth? Or the qualities that make up a wealthy character? Kiwoo obsesses over this symbol throughout the movie and he understands it in the end.<br><br>There are many people like the Kims aiming DOWN. What happens when enough people, like Kiwoo, stop? The movie leaves this question hanging open.",Brandon Yeo,2020-02-03T06:30:41Z,2
"ArtificialxSky you bring up some good points however, I think kiwoo’s aspiration to get rich in order to rescue his father is actually one of the most heartbreaking parts of the movie. bong said in an interview that it would take kiwoo 564 years to work and save enough to buy that house, which shows just how broken our socioeconomic system is. it seems reasonable that someone should be able to get out of poverty from their hard work alone, but in reality kiwoo is powerless against capitalistic society and will be stuck in the same metaphorical basement apartment until he dies. this myth of upward mobility only exists in our society so that the poor will continue to have hope in the system that exploits their labor and eventually kills them. this hope for future upward mobility upholds the system because the lower class is too busy trying to survive and get out of poverty to have an effective revolution that changes the system. bong uses kiwoo’s aspirations to show that whether an individual can climb the economic ladder does not matter because the cycle of class struggle will continue. kiwoo could become rich but the new tenants of his old family apartment will still get flooded out and the poor will continue to suffer while the ignorant rich continue to profit off the labor of the poor below them.",elliphant21,2020-02-03T06:02:52Z,4

"Hi! I agree with what you&#39;re saying, although I think it might speak to a larger issue with theory and film analysis itself. When you apply a theory to a certain film, you&#39;re looking at it from a certain lens (in this case I looked at it from a socio-economic/cultural studies lens). I think it just requires multiple analyses and theories to observe the movie from different angles. Perhaps there&#39;s another theory that can explain why the Parks are victims. Maybe you could apply feminist film theory to explore Mrs. Park&#39;s character, or auteur theory to explore how Bong uses space/architecture to visualize his themes. But I don&#39;t think I could tackle all of the film&#39;s complex themes in a single video. I also agree that the relationship between the rich and poor is very complex and I don&#39;t think the Parks themselves are necessarily the villains of the movie, but actually the system they&#39;re living in (&quot;we live in a society&quot; lol). I also do think that the Parks&#39; ability to physically remove themselves from the situation/house does speak volumes, even if they&#39;ve experienced a traumatic situation.

Love this analysis! One nitpick: Asian cultures favor paler skin just in general—it isn’t a result of western idealism,Jasmine Wang,2020-02-01T09:00:24Z,0

"I can&#39;t speak for other Asian cultures but as someone who grew up in the Philippines (which is where that Palmolive beauty ad came from), western idealism definitely plays a role in the aspirations for lighter skin. Another idealized Filipino beauty standard is having a nose that is &quot;matangos&quot;, which apparently is translated as a &quot;high-bridged nose&quot;, but the implied translation is &quot;not flat&quot;, &quot;not stereotypically Filipino&quot;, &quot;more White&quot;, &quot;more Spanish&quot;, etc.",Jinno792,2020-02-01T11:42:45Z,0

"Well. I grew up in South Korea during the 90&#39;s as a rich family but went to a public school for my parents believed that it is important for me to do that. After my birthday party as a kid, a lot of kids wanted to come over my house. They stole my toys and snacks. One kid who started to bully me a little was asked to leave and he smashed a window on the way out. Since we never moved, the &quot;rich boy&quot; stigma always followed and I was always bullied or cast out. When I went to collage, I thought it was a new start and never told anyone where I&#39;m from all anything about my upbringing. But one day I let my guards down and invited a friend over to my place. After that the rich boy stigma began again. My friends always told me how I don&#39;t have to worry about student loans, that I don&#39;t really need to get a job, some even told me that me studying hard for exams was just for personal satisfactions while for others its about life and death. When I told them I never had friends growing up and was bullied all my life because of my family&#39;s wealth they just shrugged and said that&#39;s easy compared to being ordinary people&#39;s struggle.<br><br>My grandfather made an honest living. My dad also made an honest living. I hope I can make an honest living and continue the legacy. But I plan to &quot;draw the line&quot; from now on. I don&#39;t expect to be welcomed by the poor or the so called &quot;normals&quot; so I don&#39;t welcome them. I&#39;m happy to live as a employer who pays handsomely and I&#39;m happy that they see me just as that.<br><br>If you want to be happy as a normal dude, learn to be content or become rich. If you want to be happy as a rich, don&#39;t try to be down to earth or any of that bullshit because you will be hated. Pay handsomely and use that to draw your line.",DLDmaster,2020-02-01T02:06:31Z,6

"Factories workers in China are being exploited? So what do we do? Do we eliminate all the factories in China, or do we eliminate all the factories in the world? Do we eliminate all factory jobs and all service jobs? What jobs are considered dignified? The problem I see is that the Chinese worker are being singled out as singularily the ones being exploited in the economic system. In reality, it is not as simple as black, and white. Everyone in the economic system is being exploited in one way or another. Also, that jobs, and roles are considered dignified is also subjective. The conclusion the narrator is trying to draw does not do justice to the actually complexity of the movie. The movie is telling us a largest, more profound points.",Phillip,2020-02-01T02:01:32Z,1

This is not really the case. They are being paid a livable wage in China where the cost of living is much lower. Also, Chinese wages is the highest in developing countries.

"parasite is a very well written movie It talks about power, greed and hope,it says that how humans are capitalist by nature, That a person only thinks about himself that when a poor family has power, they will not help other poor but will only think about themselves, There is a power hierarchy in the society and the one who has more power, he considers the one with less power as a filth. This film talk about privilege also that a higher class person gets everything but a lower class person has to work 10 times more to get that, Everything in this film was well balanced there is no villain in this film the real villain is the situation<br>Yes bong didn&#39;t give any reason for &quot;all or nothing&quot; but that&#39;s the whole point that&#39;s why it feels surprising,The murder of Mar Park by Mar kim was a very psychological act,The murder of Mar Park by Mar Kim is very surprising and to understand it, you need to understand the psychology of Mar Kim.<br>Kim never wanted to kill Park, it was the situation that led to this act,Jealousy and anger have already boiled over in Kim&#39;s mind against Park,And it&#39;s shown in a very subtle way,He used to respect the park a lot, but later he came to know that he just thinks of him as a worker who stinks alot This thing was deeply disturbing to Kim inside,A big truth was already revealed in front of Kim(secret bunker),And right after that he heard Mr. Park say about himself that he stinks, and later her whole house got washed away by the rain all trouble came upon him in one night Still, he has to go to work in the morning, where the Park family is about to enjoy a birthday party But still the park treats him like a worker wo stinks they are completely unaware of his problem,Even when geun se killed Kim&#39;s daughter, Park was only thinking about his son and he should logically think about his son first But Kim felt bad for this work of Park because of his hatred, when Park shrunk his nose to avoid the smell, then Kim felt worse,in that situation, his suppressed hatred and jealousy came out in the form of anger, which led to the murder of the park. Kim had no Big reason to kill Park and he never want to kill mr Park it just happened to him like a DREAM a BAD DREAM And he got punished for this because he did wrong he had to leave his family and stay in the bunker and later he also apologized to the park, but now nothing is going to happen with this apology, crime was already committed now he will have to atone for it ,this shows the jealousy and hatred of the lower class against the higher class, And the movie never justifies Kim&#39;s crime,Kim was not a psycho killer, he was a normal person, he committed this crime, which he regrets, but now nothing is going to happen by regretting,In the last, a conversation between a father and son is shown which is very emotional, a son will never consider his father a criminal He also knows that my father is not such a person, but nothing can happen now,In the end, the film ends on Hope, despite all this, ki woo never stops hoping,I don&#39;t know whether he will be able to get that house or not, but God bless him to buy such a house so that when it rains next time, he can enjoy it with his family like mr park does.<br>Both families were not parasite in this film the real parasite was human greed,hatred, jealousy and situation",G Chudasama Darshit,2023-03-27T02:56:30Z,1

"This film is less a <b>class critique</b> than it is a <b>subversive parody of the heist trope.</b><br><br>There is no consideration of the Parks at the end because, like a bank or art gallery, they exist to serve as a foil for the protaganists&#39; whacky exploits.<br><br>There is certainly aesthetic contrast between the &#39;elevated&#39; life and the &#39;subterranean&#39; life, but this is to serve the parody.<br><br>As for it&#39;s creator&#39;s claim that the rich are parasites as well, I submit that he is trolling us -- that this is part of the parody. (After all, it depicts the Kim&#39;s as hiding like cockroaches under the furniture. And it portrays the anodyne Park family as ... having an evilly overactive olfactory sense?

"I don&#39;t think the rich guy deserved what he got in the end. I think they are the victims here. They never treat them bad. Both the husband and wife give respect to the ones working for them. Only time he&#39;s not so respectful is when he talks about that smell and even then I didn&#39;t think it was enough to get him killed (plus leaving his kids fatherless and wife, widowed).<br>The poor family on the other hand conned them, stole two people&#39;s jobs when they could&#39;ve certainly stopped at their son and daughter, used their living room when the family was away on a trip and used their food and alcohol. And to top it all of they&#39;re talking about having it all for themselves as if they worked for it (not to mention, how they treated that previous housekeeping lady and her husband). If they hadn&#39;t got greedy, none of those things would&#39;ve happened. And when you consider that the rich guy worked from the bottom up (some Korean commenter said that), they&#39;re even more in the wrong. <br>I don&#39;t know if this was intended, but it seemed to me that the movie wanted us to feel a bit sympathetic for the poor family in the end.

"I felt like the Kim&#39;s family met their Karma, even though it was depressing and awful.. First off, the two kids could have kept up the deception and atleast saved and try to better their circumstances. The sister, Ki-jung  had stood a really good chance because she was clever, talented and impressed the Park family. But what put me off was that they had the house keeper and driver dismissed out of pure selfishness and greed. They capitalized  too much off the situation. The second thing was that they outright refused to help the previous housekeeper even when she offered to pay them, yet they were in the same class as her. Plus they were the reason for her being out of a job. What would it cost to feed a guy once a week, when they themselves were deceiving the Park family. None of them took into account the mental health or desperation of the housekeeper and her husband. SMH.   And what I couldn&#39;t understand, how comes no one thought of their home which was in a basement during a storm.

"a student at my university wrote an essay last year on the amount of visible lines between characters in almost every shot - they’re separated by staircase railings, bookcases, walls in the background etc etc to show the division between classes. in addition there is an emphasis on height differences with characters moving up &amp; down staircases, uphill and downhill, living in both basements, lying under the table etc. it’s an incredibly smart way that manages to properly Show these divisions and how poor people are invisible to the rich without explicitly saying so.<br><br>many people have tried to nitpick at this movie and say things like ”how could the son have survived a blow to the head with a rock” or other minute critiques but im telling you, bong joon-ho thought of it all. the stone is a gift from his friend to represent academic success and serve as a good luck charm + source of aspiration, but when the basement is flooded it floats, showing how hollow the son’s hopes are whilst simultaneously solving what would otherwise be a possible plot hole. it’s clear that this movie was made with incredible care and effort. ive been a fan of bong joon-ho for several years now, so it is very satisfying to see him finally get the recognition he deserves. this IS a fantastically well made film and worth every last bit of the hype.<br><br><br>also it was kinda funny seeing celebrities praise this film without understanding it at alllll",Olivia S,2021-01-19T20:26:35Z,2

"They scammed themselves into the jobs in the Park household but once into the job, they did the work, essentially and did the job well. Besides being overall, a social satire on the wealth/income divide in modern South Korea (and the world),  it shows also how the disadvantaged have so much trouble breaking into steady employment --- even jobs in households,  security guard jobs --- those jobs that conventionally are thought to be lower class jobs and supposedly easy to get.  The movie also shows that the poor aren&#39;t stupid, unqualified/unaccomplished or deserve to be poor --- they are just the vast majority who don&#39;t have the capital, the luck or other means to get further education, strike it in business, etc. because the post-capitalist world rewards the few and supresses the rest.  The real world is of course complex but the movie did a great job portraying a pretty realistic world while at the same time telling an engaging story that was funny, sarcastic, and tragic.  I agree,  virtually a flawless movie that was visually stunning.   I watched it late last year in a movie theatre --- remember those?",Chaise Pomme,2020-08-30T05:14:50Z,7

We should have been born a few decades earlier. Then we would have been making money. and I know when I say this people going to start saying no you don&#39;t know anything you&#39;re just a stupid person who&#39;s never been poor. We&#39;re when I came to America, we had to live in a home with other families. It&#39;s not that working hard is the problem. The problem is that the rich are getting richer.

I&#39;ll point out 2 stupid moments that stood out in the movie, 1st the scene were instead of working together so they can keep each others secrets, the old caretaker would rather have a fight 2 against 4. 2nd the father watched his daughter gets stabbed and his wife fighting for her life and he just stood there doing  nothing. He was more triggered with the smelly insult rather than saving his wife and daughters lives, does that make any sense?",Loimike31,2020-05-10T16:04:10Z,0

"No matter what wins any one single award, someone can always think of something that might be technically better and didn&#39;t get it. At the end of the day, something has to win and Parasite is a perfectly good movie with good writing, and a high degree of competency. For the year, I&#39;m not sure I can think of a better Korean film, or one that isn&#39;t better in some ways but worse in others. I also don&#39;t think anything about it was over-hyped. It pretty much came out of nowhere and had very little mainstream hype. <br><br>The 2nd point about the smelly insult. You are watching the moment he makes a turn as a character. You have to think of that whole sequence as being together processed by him. The sniff is the straw that breaks the camel&#39;s back. He&#39;s clearly realizing things during the whole sequence. I had some issues with it too. I wish he had come to his realizations and made the turn a bit sooner. I thought while he waited in the bushes he was going to have put it all together and would have reacted &quot;better&quot; sooner. But the sequence doesn&#39;t fail. And if we look in real life, people end up often make that turning point late and at odd times. I&#39;ve seen people put up with plenty of shit all day long, take in stride and be professional, but then go off &quot;get triggered&quot; because a tape dispenser is empty. Yes it might be nice if people took action at more opportune times, but they don&#39;t. <br><br>Two moments in a movie doesn&#39;t ruin it anyway. We can pick any movie apart until it looks like a train wreck. Frankly too, if you watch a lot of Korean or other foreign films, those two bits can&#39;t really bother you that much. Even just looking through the director and writers&#39; filmographies....come on, you can&#39;t be that bothered by two explainable scenes otherwise...it feels like you just are looking for a reason to complain about Parasite.",Average Picker,2020-05-17T19:54:45Z,0

"I just saw this film tonight. It deserved the Best Picture Oscar. It made me think and it was perfect. Normally, the best picture winner is met with a meh...or it won because it is  a Hollywood Message movie. Parasite deserved the Oscar and if you have not seen it, go to Hulu and do so now.

"Ya, the poor characters in the movie were portrayed as cunning, but were also waaaaaayyyyyy worse people than those in the upper class. Why is everyone missing that major point?

"I wasn’t a huge fan of the movie. The only idea I enjoy for myself is the fathers confinement at the end acts as his jail cell, the son won’t ever reach that point of buying the house and if he does he would be too late, and the mother grief for losing her daughter which I personally think the son should’ve passed or remained with lasting trauma to his brain and the mother should have been in prison. The son went downstairs with the intent to kill. The fathers inability to control his emotions and responding to the husbands disparaging of his odor  caused them to be further trouble. Even if it was the tipping point for him seeing his daughter die that was a direct result of his families choices. I understand the display of disadvantages between different classes but you start to lose respect for the lower class when they start to have complete disregard for other people. Even the son kissing his student in which his best friend trusted him not to. Not a horrible movie but I missed why people are praising the movie so much. I watched it twice and maybe the third time might shine some light.",AliixKatz,2020-04-16T03:24:32Z,0
"I think that&#39;s part of the point of it though, you&#39;re not supposed to root for this family because they&#39;re poor and you&#39;re not supposed to hate the Parks because they&#39;re rich.

"The korean age very peculiar. When someone birth, starts with 1 years old. and change his age every january 1st. Because, in korean language, there is upper word. So age is very important. Kids go to school at 8 years old. korean age. 2001 born, 2008, 8 years old. and  6 - 3 - 3. elementary, middle, high. 초등, 중, 고등학교. so, 18 years old is sophomore(2nd), but the other country. its 16 years, if she didnt pass the birthday. and ki-woo is 20~21 years old. In korea, 30% students, re-test the  universty entrance test. It&#39;s one of the most important test.(parents make their  children go to acadamy, cost more than 400$ per month) if you have low point score, you can retest the next years one. (only 1 per year).While studyig in home (not school. already graduated), and i dont know how many times ki-woo re test the &quot;수능&quot;. <br>And maybe this answer could not satisfy your question.

Are you all seriously trying to tell me that conning your way into a rich persons life is perfectly fine and justified if you’re jealous enough and poor enough?

Parasite was an above average movie but nothing hugely special, sure it was ok but was flawed in its own way. The third act was a mess and made no sense. We are now being enthralled by these films for simply using the artform how it should and has been used before by many masterful films.... I think that the quality of large scale productions has gone down so much (marvel) that we are overwhelmed when something is simply above average and using cinema int he way it should be used as a artform....

"Because he simply snapped. He was already devastated by the fact that his house was flooded. He notices the rich man’s wife had a problem with his smell because of the flood. All of this happening, while he has to dance to these rich people’s tune (dress up as a native american for the rich man’s son). All of this was already eating up inside him. Seeing his daughter being stabbed and dying. And the rich man only caring for his car keys to save his son, and making a big deal of the dying dude’s smell, that was it. It made the dad snap.

"Not a native English speaker so I am going to try my best.<br>First of all, let&#39;s give credit where credit is due: the movie is well shot, it builds some very artistic pictures at times, I find it funny, it has some cool metaphors, it&#39;s fast paced, accessible and enjoyable.<br>I also would like to assume that this is not an absurdist or surreal like film( stuff that you find in books written by Kafka, plays by Beckett or paintings by Dali, where common sense or logic are taken away for a specific purpose).<br>The action portrayed in the movie is supposed to be based on certain cause and effect situations, to make it realistic. Although, despite the general positive reviews that this movie has received, I&#39;m afraid this is not the case. Parasite is anything but plausible, and here is why:<br><br>-Rich families may be superficial, but if the Parks in Parasite represent a symbol for rich families for an universal understanding, then everything is wrong. Rich people are not stupid, I find it odd that they do not have security cameras or some kind of guards to keep the house safe in their absence. It does not seem plausible that mrs and mr Park simply agree to hire this poor family without any research of their interests, or background.<br>I find it odd that they did not know, even though they bought such a big house, that they did not have a basement.<br><br>-It feels wired that they got rid of the old housekeeper, in such a manner, that they truly believe she had TBC. The scene where mr Kim spills ketchup on the used napkin is very reminiscent of some cheap Mexican soap opera. And then he just touches mrs Park hand :&quot;Ah fuck it is just tuberculosis, relax&quot;<br><br>-Its absurd of how the Kims simply do all that mess when the Parks are away.<br><br>-The aspect that the old housekeeper just comes back, saying that she forgot smth in the basement( a fucking human being), with all kinds of bruises, cutting out the camera, does not add up.<br><br>-The fact that the Kims where really skilled and street smart does not make any sense on how they did not find jobs before.<br><br>-After their already implausible escape, when they return to their flooded home, the Kims return for the young son birthday looking flawless, after they spent that night in odd conditions.<br><br>-In the birthday scene, after the parody-like events, in life and death situations, mr Park is annoyed by the smell?<br>really? when his son is dying he just wants his car keys, like no one else from the guests drives a car.<br><br>And these are just a few of the facts that the movie doesn&#39;t get right, it feels awkward.<br>Let alone the political message, where the old housekeeper mocks and imitates North Korean politics.<br>The are also so many cliches, like the moment when the Kims stumble and they are seen by the old housekeeper, in that particular moment.<br>And one more thing, I know that this movie is full of metaphors, but what kind of crime investigation does not properly search ALL the house, basement included.",Prometheus,2020-03-04T17:12:37Z,4
"@Juan Gómez Fuentes Thank you man, for adding more arguments and examples.<br>I feel that all this positive reaction is a domino effect, where the so called &quot;movie critics&quot; develope artificial opinions that people simply take for granted.<br><br>Like you said, Parasite is OK but stands miles away from its ratings.<br><br>Have a nice day!",Prometheus,2020-07-16T12:10:23Z,0
"Finally I find somebody that thinks like me about this film. I criticize the same aspects. The characters make thing that are extremelly out of their personality. The Kims demostrated to be extremelly smart and planning everything ahead, specially the kids. Then they make that stupid drunk party in the house risking loosing everything?. They let the old housekeeper just enters when they are all there with all the mess?.  The main character has demostrated during the movie be very smart and focus in the detais, planning everything in advance, and then at the end, he decides in the middle of a party, with tons of people in the house, to go to the basement? And alone?. Then, like you said, the police is not going to find the basement after 3 killing in the house, they dont think, where this guy came from?. Specially having blood in the accesible basement.<br><br>Then, like you say, the cliches, like hidding under the bed, forcing the situation that everybody goes downstairs when everybody in under the table. <br><br>I find very silly the ending of the killing in the garden. After all the entire story that the writter has been able to construct, is he ending it like that, with a silly metaphor?. <br><br>I normally would have seen this movie and said, Ok, it is a good movie, and go on. But all this crazyness with a 99% in rotten tomatoes, and all the comment just saying that is the best movie ever and this like that makes me feel that I am the only one that has seen the movie. <br>I do not see where this movie really is the best ever. <br>- In cinematografy is fine, but it is far far far from being better that 1917, or Birdman, or Interstellar, or a ton of movies more. <br>- The actors are fine, but sometimes they did it quite bad, with those silly over reactions in their faces. People speaks about this acting like if Daniel Day-Lewis made them. <br>- The script is not that good. The original idea is good but the developement, specially in the half part is not well develope, not at least to make as good as people say. The writter abuse a lot of take the character way out of their personalities to make them do thing that produce the situation that the writer is forcing. Then those silly non-funny cliches like the scene of hidding under the table werent necessary at all.<br>-The ending is just a metaphore that the writter wanted to make even when it makes no sense and it is a silly ending, when he could have done something much better to develope the situation with the guy in the basement. You want to see a good ending, check Seven. <br><br>At the end, a good movie, but come on guys, it is not that good, it is really far from be a all times master piece. Maybe this overreaction is due to the fact that the last two years has been quite bad in real memorable movies. Or maybe people feel a little bit identified with some aspects of the movie. I do know.<br><br>I feel like when I was recommended to see &quot;The mist&quot;, and when I check online the critics were throught the roof, and end up been one of the worst movies I have ever seen.",Juan Gómez Fuentes,2020-05-03T14:00:36Z,1

"I am glad I did not listen to this whole review, as he gave away something rather important. I thought that the first three quarters of the film is really great, some fantastic visuals, and even dialogue that you have to remember, and do for stuff later. There is that fantastic surprise which is the height of the film. But from then on, I felt the film went down hill. It was so predictable. Also the last ten or so minutes could have really been trimmed. down. For me the best Korean film that I have seen is train To Busan, and zombie movies are not my cup of tea. For the first three quarters of the film, I though it was the greatest Korean him ever made. As for it winning the academy award as best picture, I felt that the Hollywood movie and Irishman were far better. No one has suggested it, but perhaps its best picture award was a backlash to the still Hollywood so white campaign.",elnick1000,2020-03-04T08:06:35Z,0

"This movie brought some memories.. ten years ago I met a girl while playing an online game..then we talked through messenger..she wanted to meet me..but we lived in different cities..so, in summer vacations I happened to be at the same city...she insisted that I had to go to her house and meet her...I did, she lived in a very exclusive place outside the city, only wealthy people lived there... So, after we met each other, and she realized I wasnt a wealthy guy, she stopped talking to me, no explanation, no answer..no anything. She just pretended that I never existed.",JuanSitoh,2020-02-27T12:45:03Z,0

@Gabriela Gro They probably had to pay back debts first or they had a subconscience feeling that it would be all temporary and that their scheming would be discovered. They do drink expensive beer from Japan after they got hired by the wealthy family.,vangrails,2020-04-16T05:36:32Z,0
"Gabriela Guerrero i think you are misunderstanding it entirely. The kims werent really after monetary gain but a rise in social status. They were literally unemployed, living underground moles of society when the movie started. When they individually start to leech into the rich their position subtly shifts from box making slave to customers for example. And also in reality, working as a tutor, housekeeper and driver doesnt actually pay that well especially enough to get themselves a new house",joeykiller,2020-03-01T01:40:02Z,0
@Gabriela Gro ok that&#39;s a good point I wondered the same thing but forgot by the time the movie ended.<br>I mean they must have gotten quite a lot of money (I think) another little problem i think is that we don&#39;t really know how long they have worked for the park family like we don&#39;t get any dates (or I just didn&#39;t pay any attention),Massive dnegel here,2020-02-28T21:36:00Z,0

"No one seem to notice a basic flaw in the movie in that the poor family is played by actors who in no way appear to  be from the lower class. They all appear to be well fed, with straight white teeth,  and with salon haircuts. The  various characters that they play can convincingly speak English, are computer literate to the point where they can forge believable  documents, pass them selves off as trained therapists, run a modern household in an upper class home as a housekeeper, and handle a limousine. They also have the social skills to pull off these  roles. I kept wondering during the movie &quot;Why are these people poor to begin with?&quot; I believe this movie does a poor job of representing the lower classes that it claims to sympathize with.",M Good6591,2020-02-24T00:29:11Z,0

And I never said watching tv or a movie mindlessly was a bad thing and I certain never said you were one of those mindless people but most who watch tv shows or movies on a regular basis do it at some point or another.  I was just talking about the motive for watching movies.  Some do it for mental stimulation and some do it to take their mind off things.

Also the car scene where the mrs park is saying how great it was for the rain to fall to bring up this beautiful day for the garden party without knowing it destroyed his entire home. <br>Then his daughter bleeding to death his son unconscious bleeding from his head and even in an emergency situation mr park still has the bear of thought to hold his nose to retrieve the keys was his tipping point and he lost control.

"Am I the only one who like it but didn&#39;t think it was great? <b>spoilers</b> It doesn&#39;t delve very deeply into the characters or the theme. It&#39;s a comedy that touches on some interesting themes but never explores them. I can&#39;t think of any scene that I would just want to rewatch again and again like the great films I like. For me, that&#39;s how you know a movie is great. If there are a number of scenes in the movie you want to rewatch like the Travolta and Thurman date in Pulp Fiction. <br><br><br>Also, the fact that the dead housekeeper is ignored bothered me. This parasite family left her there to die and got away with it.<br><br><br>Good movie--A--not A+.",GizmoMaltese,2020-02-17T18:02:33Z,1
"I think personally it delves into the characters’ motives and personas very well. It especially outlines how in asian culture people’s social and wealth status is a measure of their value and success.<br>Scenes that stood out to me spoilers* are the belt of trust scene which is beautifully shot and edited along with the great score that accompanied it. When mr Kim has a final look back at his home before leaving in the flood was another stand out scene. The scene with mr Kim driving and the mother opens the window is also fantastic. I also loved the scene with mr Kim and mr park where they are dressed as American Indians, it brilliantly depicts the power of authority from wealth.<br><br>But movies are subjective to the people’s personal taste however for me it resonated. I think the film perfectly touches on the superiority complex and division from gaps in wealth and social status. The film also portrays how in today’s society we subconsciously view others inferior to us when they fall below us on the ladder and the constant struggle to elevate and project us up the class structure.",Bruce Jones,2020-02-19T09:02:53Z,1

"Viewing the world of dichotomous the rich and the poor in neo-capitalist society from the perspective of the lower class. Life exists over the ground and under the ground. And semi-basement(&quot;Banjiha&quot; in the movie) under the ground. And basement under the semi-basement. The traces of poverty that cannot be hidden remain unhidden. Life under the &quot;Banjiha&quot; coexists with the desire for the over-the-ground life and the fear of falling the under-the-ground. We can&#39;t share the happiness in our hands, so the gap between them is only widened. The film tells a dream that can&#39;t be fulfilled. The characters&#39; performances are filled with all the scenes without any gaps, and they meet with humor like an awl even though they follow their hearts in unexpected ways.

WTF...JUST HAPPENED??&quot;...AND....&quot;OMFG&quot;!!! <br><br>That last turn made me get why it had such an impact on a lot of people....Sure the class of people etc etc was packed into a good story....But I never thought to myself...&quot;Usually lower income people etc are considered imbeciles in movies....If anything I roll my eyes a bit cause they are usually portrayed as victims...which also usually isnt the case IRL...IMO.<br><br>But this movie didn&#39;t treat them as imbeciles or victims....And also didn&#39;t treat the wealthy family as just evil people preying on others....I saw them as simply being raised a certain way etc and they had an outlook...but with no ill intent in mind. <br><br>Rich or poor...all had good and bad qualities...Which are subjective in a lot of ways anyway....it was nice to see that shown realistically for those characters while understanding no matter what side your on....This particular instance CANNOT be used as a generalization of either class....everyone is different.<br><br>THAT LAST 25% THOUGH....THAT CULMINATION WAS INDEED AN AMAZING TURN.<br><br>And the best line of the movie...&quot;Oh, Mr. Park.... RESPECT&quot;!!!!!!<br>That guy was hands down F&#39;N Awesome haha.<br><br>Overall loved it.",Spills51,2020-02-15T13:39:47Z,4

":::SPOILERS::: What is it with you americans going all hurray for that film??? With all due respect (and love for Hollywood and independent movie makers in the US): have you missed european cinemas since the seventies?!I was shocked when I heard it got an Oscar , no: THE Oscar! I didn&#39;t know anything about &#39;Parasite&#39; before watching it, so: perfect conditions, right? But I was not pleased. I liked the acting, tne camera work and art direction, but that&#39;s about it. I quite like the Korean movie scene too but this movie felt very european in a way, like one of those clever french comedies like &#39;Tanguy&#39; for example. But: I have seen so many better scripts, more absurd plots and more cruel (and better developed) twists in the last decades (yes I&#39;m old) that I was bored to hell in this one.<br>What is so fucking special, Bong Joon-ho did here? Admittedly, the basic idea is a neat one, but it goes nowhere. The characters acted like geniuses and improvised the bejesus out of them when the story needed it most - only to act like complete idiots: when the story needed it most. The only thing I did know when the film started (because I couldn&#39;t move my eyes fast enough away from the brief description) was that there is a plot twist. I hoped this would do the trick. For me it didn&#39;t. So there was a man hiding in the secret cellar. Wow. When they fell down the stairs so the real dramatic turning point that Joon-ho needed could occur I suffered a major second hand embarresment attack. That felt so insanly cheap I almost stopped watching. After that: why go dramatic after all?? Why have people dying????!!!! it made no sense. It was such an obvious and &#39;crafted&#39; surprise - like uuuuh, NOW everybody will be shocked - that I felt nothing but: C&#39;MOOOONs over and over again. Have the story escalate? Yeah sure, it desperately needed escalation at that point (and maybe before)! But why had it to be stabbing and thumping?! Don&#39;t get me wrong, I like my good amount of violence in a movie, but this felt so forced.<br>I don&#39;t hate that movie. It&#39;s worse. It bored me. And that&#39;s something I can never forgive ;)<br>Anyways, Chris, I just subbed, because I think you have a very engaging way of talking about movies, where both head AND heart are involved - like it should be in my opinion. Great stuff! Rock on!",Miki Laggard,2020-02-15T10:26:21Z,0
"I&#39;m not saying everyone is like this (I know there are some) that won&#39;t watch films with subtitles because they&#39;re not used to it, but hear me out on this: If I can watch Seven Samurai in it&#39;s unbridled 3 &amp; a half runtime with subtitles, you can definitely do the same with Parasite, a movie that&#39;s a fraction of the length of Seven Samurai.",Brennan Martinez,2020-02-15T10:23:13Z,0

"Connor Webb i was able to predict parasite from the trailer, i dont know if thats just a me thing, but it was terribly predictable, and the ending seemed thrown in there at the last second. Sure, the dad killing him cause he didnt like being called smelly could be symbolic, but you have to think about it in a realistic sense, and thats just way too unbelievable. I just think ford vs ferrari had a much better message and the fact it was a true story made it all the better. Joker, even though derivative, had its own spin being a comic book movie, i think it was told better than taxi driver and its acting is incredible. Parasite just fell flat, the whole time i was waiting for what “you wont be expecting” and it never came, i dont think it wins in a story sense because of that, the acting was good but because it doesnt beat Joaquin, and i laughed more times in joker than in parasite, i gues that comedy wasnt for me",Leroy,2020-02-16T15:46:18Z,0
"@Leroy That being said I still think Joker is great, in my top 15 of 2019. Ford v Ferrari is good but isn&#39;t on my list of movies I&#39;d recommend.",Connor Webb,2020-02-16T15:21:50Z,0
@Leroy I disagree. Joker is the everyday man&#39;s blend of Scorsese (Taxi Driver and King of Comedy) and Parasite (themes about class). Its the &quot;everyday man&#39;s&quot; because its a recognizable brand - DC. Ford v Ferrari was fun but it had little to offer. Bale and Damon&#39;s chemistry was good. The story was full of cheese. Leo Beebe had me rolling my eyes every time I saw him smile. Every thing the writers did to make him seem like an asshole just bored the hell out of me. I&#39;ve seen that before. Tracy Letts played a cartoon. It was cookie cutter.,Connor Webb,2020-02-16T15:20:19Z,0

And hopefully studios can remember a time like that too.

"I have seen Mother, Memories of Murder, Snow Piercer, and Host. <br><br>I was really looking forward to Parasite. To be frank, I was disappointed. Not that it is bad, but not good enough for me.<br>From the very start of the story, I found it not plausible, because we are introduced to a very poor family, and yet the son and daughter are exceptionally well informed about art, child psychology, education. <br>Maybe the South Korean low class schools are top notch?<br>Maybe it&#39;s a political statement: the poor are better educated than the rich, who are very gullible,  ignorant, and unobservant.<br>I loved the scene where the poor mother swiftly pushes the maid down the stairs. But little else.<br>I have seen Mother and Memories of Murder twice. I doubt I will see Parasite again. I could not suspend my disbelief: If the son and daughter are so capable, why do they not have jobs?<br>And, the Basquiat-like painting by the rich kid.

SPOILER REVIEW FOR ‘PARASITE’ PLEASEEEEE!!!!!,Tricia Young,2020-02-11T09:36:14Z,1
Who&#39;s here after The Oscars,NERDY FULLO,2020-02-11T08:59:40Z,2
"This movie is kind of a Parasite.<br><br>Here&#39;s a movie that should have been nominated and should have won the Oscar:<br><br>&quot; The Laundromat &quot;<br><br>It&#39;s a movie, which feels like a really likable informational video about insurance fraud and tricky money schemes... Lol... Antonio Banderas and Gary Oldman are just so much fun to watch!!! It&#39;s a delightful film! Based on a true story, as well, about the Panama Papers.<br><br>For me, this beats other movies nominated for movie awards. It&#39;s an artwork, turning a boring subject into pure fun, with a unique way to tell a story and make a point as well. The characters have their ups and downs, as well.  It&#39;s a Steven Soderbergh project (I had thought he retired, so glad he didn&#39;t!) and his style lifts the story and turns it into an enjoyable ride that you want to be on. <br><br>Okay, I have nothing against &quot;Parasite&quot;,  but with all the English speaking great movies this year, why did this win so much at the Oscars?  It had good directing, great acting,  great score, interesting locations and good camera work --  but, I just didn&#39;t really believe the story that much. It seemed that the upper class folks were too naive, and the lower class folks were too lucky. Plus, what were the lower class family going to do once they were found out? After all, it was just a matter of time, right? The father of that family seemed to have a higher endurance, in my understanding of the character, but then he goes nuts because he finds out the upper class boss of his isn&#39;t fond of his &#39;smell&#39;? Seriously? This just seems silly to me. I thought he was more humble, and with more grit than to let something like that bother him. Is it realistic that the upper class in South Korea don&#39;t check on anyone that they hire? Seems unrealistic to me. So, I really wanted the movie to succeed (for me) by having the characters strike a deal with each other, or reconcile and make an agreement of some kind that brings The &#39;human experience&#39; to a higher level. But, instead, we got madness, chaos and murder. Wtf? I felt this was a complete cop-out. I&#39;m guessing that this movie may have a more relevant sense to it, culturally, for those from South Korea or living there. Because it may be drawing from a reality, there, that could be worth evaluating more deeply. I thought this was an average movie, because of the story. 5 out of 10.  Snowpiercer was more interesting, and better, from this Director.",Jeffro Kraus,2020-02-11T08:42:21Z,0

"I&#39;m baffled at the amount of positive reviews this movie gets. I thought it was mediocre at best.<br><br>While I understood the plot of the movie, I didn&#39;t get why it was titled as &quot;Parasite&quot;. I mean, who is the parasite? Society teaches us that the rich are not, because they (the father in this case) work for a living. The poor can&#39;t be, since they work, too.<br><br>So either no one is a parasite or, if we accept the premise of the movie, that someone is a parasite, we must agree that everyone is a parasite. The poor family is parasitizing the rich family. The rich father has a business which may be a legal form of scam, parasitizing its (poor) customers. His wife is parasitizing him. Their children are parasitizing them.<br><br>Extrapolating, there is no such thing as a parasite in nature, because in the end, every being is a &quot;parasite&quot; on the back of other being(s) in one way or another. Life feeds on life. It&#39;s just the way it is...<br><br>Therefore, because the concept of parasitism is such an ambiguous one, I think it was a bad choice for the title of this otherwise pathetic excuse of a movie.<br><br>parasite:<br>- an organism which lives on the back of another organism of a different species;<br>- a person who exploits others and gives nothing in return.<br><br>Now the poor family may be labeled as malevolent cheaters, but cheater doesn&#39;t necessarily mean parasite.",State of Being,2020-02-10T07:47:20Z,0
"@Explicitghost Yeah... you didn&#39;t get my point.<br><br>Anyway, this movie is not a profound meditation on philosophical or social issues (though it pretends hardly to be that), so there is nothing &quot;to read between the lines&quot;.<br><br>I&#39;ve seen where the story would go after the first few scenes, so watching till the end was a grind more or less. Actually, to be honest, it exceeded my expectations in terms of how bad it was going to be. It is just a convoluted mess failing on so many levels, nothing more, though I understand why some people might mistake this for something that it is not. But a piece of crap is a piece of crap. Nothing more to say...",State of Being,2020-02-12T11:42:55Z,0
"You answered how they are parasites in your later paragraphs buy ill recap. The poor family relies on exploiting the rich family to earn a living, doing so by scamming them and ruining the other house workers lives to replace them with their own family. The Rich family relies on the poor family to do the most basic of tasks to keep the home a livable place. They cant cook, do the dishes, or wash their own laundry. So in a way both families are parasites to each other. the twist of the movie serves as a grim reminder that it isn&#39;t just poor vs rich, but also poor vs poor as they battle for the welfare of the rich family. Being a parasite in the term you use isn&#39;t as simple as working or not working. Being caught up on simple issues like that hasn&#39;t allowed you to &quot;read in between the lines&quot; during your viewing of the movie.<br><br>You should give it a rewatch with that explanation in mind. Personally I think the film is great with amazing acting, writing, cinematography, and meaning. But it isn&#39;t perfect, it relies on deus ex machinas to push to the story along a little to much. But 100% a recommendation to anyone I know.",Explicitghost,2020-02-12T10:38:17Z,0

"I&#39;m Korean and one of the details most foreigners(and even Koreans) miss to mention is that those families were never like that poor/rich all the way through their life! <br><br>The rich family&#39;s dad is introduced in several details as he started from the bottom - and became an icon for it(The term Ja-Su-Seong-Ga is mentioned repeatedly+His company is an IT/Tech sort of company which makes it more believable). In the poor family&#39;s house, you can see several items/details where they were far more wealthier before(not super rich, but just better off in general) just that the poor family&#39;s father had a failed business that lead this family into this poverty. Thoses family members aren&#39;t incompetant at all. Dad has several great skillsets, mom was a national level athlete, sister is good at art, and the son is educated enough to teach the rich daughter.The sub-poor couple&#39;s husband even owned his own small business back in the day.<br><br>You act like you were born with the class, in reality, you&#39;re just stationed into a system. Capital hierarchy blinds you into believing the wealthy deserves of their own class while the poor believes the same, respectiong and admiring the upperclass. loads of casualty without any villans.",wishing9wonder,2020-02-07T08:20:07Z,2336

"@Peeps and MooMoo plus the ending was a mixture of false sense of hope plus despair. as the director also said, it WILL be impossible for the son to buy that house. hence the ongoing chain of class pyramid.",wishing9wonder,2021-10-15T15:25:31Z,0
"@Peeps and MooMoo I get the point you initially followed and yes the ending was intended to make you feel that way. It was never about anybody &#39;deserving&#39; of anything. The intention of the director(as he famously admitted all the time)was this.<br><br>Most of the time bad things only happened to both the poors. They were conned, they lost their jobs, they lost their house, they lost their dignity, they lost the sense of existing as a human being and reduced down to their occupation and function. they were invisible to the rich. whenever they tried to connect with the rich(like asking if they loved there SO and asking for a handshake) the rich appeared as if they were offended even, as if they were crossing a line or something.<br><br>There is no justification for the killing. Heck even the poor dad felt guilty of his actions. the director wanted to point out that as long as this inhumane class hierarchy of welth exists, very very bad things will definately happen to anyone, even the rich. it&#39;s not a matter of right or wrong, or who deserves what, it will happen.<br><br>even tho they try so hard, the rich family is highly disfunctional without the poors labor. however they draw an imaginary line between them and the poor. you can hate the poor hold them accountable for their action. but no matter what, once in a while an end of a knife blade will definately be headed towards you if this class system exists. the director wanted the ones who justify and lives(wins) upon this system to acknowledge that it horrible things may happen to them.",wishing9wonder,2021-10-15T15:23:15Z,0
"What bothers me about this movie is that the poor family cheats and lies to take advantage of the rich family. This is like saying that only the dishonest get ahead, and if you play by the rules, you will be left behind. Even the poorer family in the basement have more integrity. Although the poor family gets their comeuppance at the end, I still didn&#39;t like that they were portrayed as the &quot;heroes.&quot;",David Gonzales,2020-02-07T06:44:41Z,0
"Isn&#39;t that the truth about society though? The dishonest find a way to win while those who play by the rules get left behind. And I don&#39;t think they were ever portrayed as heroes. They are portrayed as frauds who take advantage of the gullibility of others, but are also sympathetic characters who need to to be clever and cunning because they need it to survive. Also it&#39;s not like they got a hero&#39;s ending either. If anything they kind of got what they deserved in the end.",freepeople091,2020-02-10T12:43:21Z,0
David Gonzales They really weren’t portrayed as “heroes” at all and they even paid a price for it at the end. One of the things that I loved about this film is that all of the characters were flawed in their own ways. In a sense it really takes a good hard look at humanity and shows that in the end we’re all our own worst enemies in a class system that encourages us to succumb those terrible qualities within us to “get ahead”.,Wonka Bars,2020-02-08T16:02:13Z,2

"Whether or not you agree with the families actions you understand Ho’s characters are so real that it’s easy to empathize with them. If this was an American movie it could have easily been the narrative that the rich are evil and the underclass are righteous. The rich family aren’t inherently evil because they have money, but because they don’t appreciate it. That’s why we don’t mind ki-woo and his family manipulating them as much. We also know their living situation isn’t the best either, so we sympathize with them even more. This is a family that will do WHATEVER it takes to get by and you can’t fault them for that.",johnny,2020-02-06T14:29:20Z,11

I watched this because of you but wow is it overrated.  So many issues in this movie.  Can&#39;t believe you have it at such a high review.  Them all falling down the stairs and even listening so closely to the conversation made them look like embiciles when the whole first act convinced me they were so intelligent.  Him dropping the rock down the stairs was silly.  Getting drunk at the house when they go out of town was a cliche nonsense move.  I could go on but the fact that you called it flawless makes me realize we don&#39;t have the same vision of what makes a great film.  I still enjoy you though.  I&#39;ll definitely keep watching.,Shelley Cline,2020-02-01T15:23:56Z,0
"Everyone was right, this foreign film is very good. But wow did the theater I just now watched it in royally screw up the ending. For some reason, the kids running the theater went home early. And the projector auto shut-off the lens light 8 minutes before the ending. You could still hear the audio, but unfortunately I don&#39;t speak Korean, so I had no idea what happened. Thankfully, the ending is available on YouTube. I will be complaining to the corporate office of the theater and see what they do.

And Kang Ho Song is freedom....I understand they just want to show the poor family which is main character.....Forget about the other character,,,no need to show what happened to them.....But for me,,,,the rich family is also a character which need to show overall because they already a part of this character movie except the young driver and min hyuk.....For me,,,after i see the parasite movie wins golden globe award,,best foreign film,,,And then when i see the movie,,,,,it&#39;s normal movie......The fans said that many motive and moral story but for me,,,,zzzzz......I think many other korean movie can beat them.....I think parasite just get many promote......For me,,,,PARASITE IS NORMAL MOVIE......And the part which i hate mostly is the way they lied to rich family is a cruel and this movie just seem to show they are not guilty because they are poor people which cannot choose to be kind and friendly......That;s called a parasite......Poor rich family!!!!!",Detective Movie,2020-01-29T19:13:42Z,0

"This movie was Ok. I do not get the hysterical praise for it at all. I enjoyed it, it was entertaining, but to call it a “masterpiece” is way over the top. Why were we supposed to care for the poor family when all of them were shitty human beings? Are we supposed to view the rich family with contempt? If so, why? For committing the crime of being successful? The rich people didn’t murder anyone, nor did they happily fuck other people out of their livelihoods. Stick man said the poor family were pretty smart people, and I agree. So couldn’t they find a better way to get by without ruining the lives of others? The rich family did nothing to deserve what they got and neither did the driver and the housekeeper. It was a decent film with flaws. But a great film, a “masterpiece”?

I thought that scene was amazing because the movie took turn in showing that scene and the scene where previous housekeeper is throwing up in the toilet as if the toilets are connected to one another.

"I just saw the movie and I agree that it&#39;s fantastic and one of the best of the year, but that&#39;s a really long list for 2019. I just thought the massive plotholes were the only things keeping it from being a true masterpiece. Why didn&#39;t he just say &quot;hey my sister would be good for this?&quot; why did he have to pretend he didn&#39;t know her? They didn&#39;t seem to have already formulated the entire plot of bringing them all in, and I don&#39;t recall them ever mentioning why he didn&#39;t want them to know they were related. Also the buttons that controlled the lights were pretty unbelievable. Like why would that have been built that way? That was a huge MacGuffin that I found distracting when it came up. Also nothing ever came of the young boy decoding the message, so that seemed pointless. But despite all of that it was a great film and the acting and cinematography were near perfect. It&#39;s a must-see for sure.",TheRealConcertKing,2020-01-20T09:29:29Z,3
"TheRealConcertKing <br><br>q: why not just say it&#39;s his sister or why does he have to pretend that he doesn&#39;t know her<br>a: because it would sound biased to refer a relative or a friend<br><br>q: why are the lights built that way?<br>a: good question tho. i can&#39;t think of a logical answer for that too.<br><br>q: nothing happens when the kid was able to understand the morse code<br>a: it&#39;s actually more realistic that way because the kid is sort of mentally challenged and that could be the reason why he may have forgotten about it the next day. also, i think that scene was intentionally made that way for suspense build up and it keeps the viewers anxious and interested of what&#39;s going to happen next.",REV,2020-01-22T19:47:15Z,0

"i didn&#39;t feel this movie was authentic. it&#39;s more like a movie was made to fit a particular social narrative, which actually hampers the authenticity of the story and the story feels forced. the poor family is extremely smart and skilled and it&#39;s unclear how they could be so poor with all that. .people who are smart and have little regard for ethics usually thrive in a market economy even if they start with less resources.  <br><br><br><br><br>certain situations and scenes seems highly unlikely (father not getting caught or the bunker not being found after such a horrific crime,  the father surviving in the basement for years without any external help, The family&#39;s extremely reckless behavior when the rich family goes out for just one night and equally reckless and stupid actions that makes them get caught to the previous house keeper, the son fully recovering - let alone surviving - two full blows to the head with a very heavy rock) and i feel these highly improbable situations are due to the film-maker trying to push the story to fit a particular social narrative. these are common in foreign movies that are made to a western market. i highly doubt the movie was equally well accepted by the S. Korean domestic audience. <br><br><br><br><br>the social critique too is ambiguous (if that was done purposely, it would be great, but i highly doubt it). for instance, i thought the person living in the bunker represented those who live from welfare. well is that a criticism of the welfare system? if it is, then maybe there&#39;s a point. but trying to justify the jealousy and anger of the poor family doesn&#39;t sit well. ultimately, a son saw his  father getting killed in front of him and a wife lost her husband for the only reason that they were rich and successful and somehow that doesn&#39;t count?  perhaps that guy worked his ass off to reach that position. resources don&#39;t just appear out of thin air. it&#39;s the same socialist destructive and negative mindset.  it looks like the poor family is just in that situation cos they never took responsibility for their lives and in some situations it&#39;s even suggested. and it&#39;s actually the poor family that doesn&#39;t give a shit about the fellow man and undercut other poor people (like the former drive and the land lady, the boy even steals his friend&#39;s gf who helped him land a job). somehow the rich guys are assholes bcos the wife is naive and the husband doesn&#39;t like the driver poking on his private life and doesn&#39;t&#39; like how he smells? common. all this is mixed up with a forced socialist message maybe to fit a western liberal audience so ultimately the social critique too loses its focus. <br><br><br><br><br>All in all, i think the film is overrated cos it tried to fit a particular social narrative and wasn&#39;t true to the story. it&#39;s a very common issue with modern movies. it&#39;s why even though these films are called &#39;masterpieces&#39; they never reach the levels of classics like &#39;seven samarui&#39; or &#39;12 angry men&#39; (or even &#39;Joker&#39;). cos rather than staying too to the story and characters, movies like this try to fit a contemporary political ideology, which compromises the integrity story and character development.<br><br><br>i liked the movie was switching genres throughout . it is something that can become a new trend.",dharshana81,2020-01-19T15:53:56Z,0

"When Chris STuckmann said, &quot;movies like this make me want to direct&quot; solidifies what I feel about this film. It&#39;s a film that appears to be deep and takes a certain level of intelligence to understand...so when one does pick up on the symbolism/metaphors in the film they feel like they are special for being in or the secret. But the thing is...sure it&#39;s layered....but very, very thinley veiled.  Super predictable film all the way through which completely ruined it for me.

"Pretty late watcher but I just gotta say though I get the point of it, watching the characters spend 20 minutes trying to get out of their boss&#39; house was not what I would call enjoyable. Also felt some foreshadowing was done too late into the movie (kinda of nitpicking), like the youngest son seing a ghost could&#39;ve beem placed earlier into the story. Putting it after  they found out about the basement reduced the shock value. The movie had more potential to me, execution i think is more B+ to A- to be honest, I just can&#39;t see it as a perfect movie. Additionally, too many blunders from the family made the movie kind of lazy, didn&#39;t make sense why the whole family would follow the housekeeper down to the basement, or why would the mom threaten to call the police ( I mean her whole family is still there, it was not logical to call the cops at all). In the first place why would she let the housekeeper in? These plot points were lazy and made it less enjoyable.",Leonardo Tukiman,2020-01-11T17:07:15Z,0

"City of God is way better that this one. Parasites is a good movie, but is not that good in a lot of scenes. For example, uses a lot of cliches, like the typical scene of hiding under the table, or the uhhh surprise, now everyone decided to come downstairs. A lot of the decisions that the caracters make are just forced, including the ending. That is more typical of a comedy movie like American Pie. The main character, base in his personallity, would have never go down to the basement in the middle of a party, because during the movie the guy demostrate to be a masive planner, thinking out of everything, and then, he is doing that?. It is obvious that the writter was forcing the end there. You cannot see that in City of God, Seven, American Beauty, Good Will Hunting, etc. That is the biggest criticism that I have with the script, that forces situations abandoning the &quot;how that character would act in that situation&quot;. That is the equivalent of making Saul Goodman fall into a silly and obvious hustle. just to provoke a fast end or a comic situation. I am still looking for an actual deep review of the script, but for now, I can only find simplistic not based in the details reviews.",Juan Gómez Fuentes,2020-05-03T13:15:20Z,0

"I enjoy your movie reviews, and sometimes I decide to watch movies because of you. You made me watch this movie, and thank you for that. After watching this movie at the theater, I was not able to stop thinking the movie that day. I am not sure whether you gonna post a Parasite extended spoiler review or not, but I want to share how I felt about the movie. I am originally from South Korea, so I got used to both US and Korean cultures. My understanding of the movie could be different from you. There are so many things to talk, but I believe water, a stone (scholar&#39;s rock), and ghosts are important symbols. <br>1) Water: Have you taken a shower with cold water? You can try just 1 minute very cold shower, not warm&amp; hot water. It initiates your fight or flight response and makes you discomfort. The drunk guy from the beginning of the movie got cold water to wake up. I think water reveals who they are here, and water naturally flows down because of gravity inevitably. The Kim&#39;s family&#39;s day-dream (to be rich) at the Park&#39;s house has ended with rain, and they confront a brutal reality. The Park&#39;s family reveal their disgust about the poor when raining <br>2) A stone (scholar&#39;s rock): I think the stone means superficial wealth or luxuries like a Gucci bag. There&#39;s no real use of the stone here, it is an object to show off. $3000 Gucci bag is useful or practical for a person who makes $3000 per month? probably not. In our daily life, media constantly tell you that you have to buy those items to look like a rich person. The media owned by rich people, tell you that the poor people are worthless, and the rich people should be respected. In the movie, the stone shows up when flooding, and it is like &quot;id&quot; (your primitive desire) emerges from &quot;superego&quot; (conscience, reality=water). The son in the movie can&#39;t hide his desire to be rich. His deep inside clings to the stone, thinks the poor is worthless even though he is one of the poor. <br>3) Ghosts (morse code): Funny that this reminds of Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon (one of the richest people in the world), have you heard that Amazon workers can&#39;t even go to bathroom often? Ms. Park says that you will be rich if you live in the house with ghosts (hard working class, the poor). The poor are like ghosts here. The rich don&#39;t want to believe the poor exist or don&#39;t want to see them, but the rich need the poor to support their luxury life style.

Not even just being rich, but life is just becoming more and more expensive and impossible to even live comfortably. To live comfortably with economic stability is a pipe dream and it really suggests the corruption of our systems. Let&#39;s not forget the College Admissions Scandal.

"A picture is worth a thousand words: blood splattered on cake. “Let them eat cake” was Marie Antoinette’s retort to the starving masses. The blood of common workers is on the cake - the bread of the aristocracy. Sugar plantations’ slaves toil to produce the sweetness of pampered lives. The frontal head shot of indigenous features in full native head dress shows in the most subtle way how the rich have obtained advantage: the nonchalance of a violent genocide in a land grab. The seeming ease with which some come into wealth is depicted by just walking up, by avarice, or marrying up. At first glance, clothes and demeanor differentiates the rich from the poor. This determines who gets “Respect!” The poor are treated like vermin to be exterminated. Even the toilet is elevated above where the poor lives. Passerby routinely &quot;piss on them.” The smell of poverty remains even as they pass for fitting in.",Imani Malaika,2019-12-20T23:54:55Z,0

We also know the door stays open because his father goes through it afterwards on his escape after killing the rich dad and uses the handle to close it. So the plothole is: Kevin lies there unconcious, almost dead, and he is found by the daugther of the rich and family and she carries him upstairs where chaos ensues and runs away with Kevin on her back. We see this too. But she never noticed the open door to the hidden basement area that was in her house all along and that she didn&#39;t know about and wondered wtf it was? I know she wouldn&#39;t think about it in the moment because of panic, but afterwards she would have told the police about it if she did notice. And we know that she never told the police because the dad of the poor family hid down there and they were never able to find him.

Stopped halfway thru watched it rewatched ur review and I totally agree with the a+ I almost wish it had a couple gorier moments at some of the end of the pacing. But it&#39;s a great slow burn about classism. Jus wish there was a little more shock and awe to the housemaid falling down the stairs or the stabbing at the end. They felt like visceral moments that got tuned down. But that&#39;s the only complaint I had I guess I&#39;m happy that it subverted my opinion of what I was going into.

Did you grow up poor and is that why you so badly want to excuse what the family did?. Am i claiming the rich family are super morally upstanding, no, am i claiming they don&#39;t deserve what happened to them yes absolutely. You keep banging on about the &quot;deeper meanings&quot; but that doesn&#39;t mean anything, the poof family, the kid betrayed his fried who trusted him and made a move on the girl, they nearly killed the cleaning, falsely accused the limo driver, but you call these actions &quot;jumping through hoops&quot; to secure employment, they honestly are the bad guys.",99range92def,2020-03-26T17:15:16Z,0

"A very good movie. Bong Joon catches the pulse of the viewer again, literally. An A. Parasite masterfully explores the class divide in the trademark style of the director. As Joon does so well, narrative builds with full of entertaining and audacious if not disturbing sequences enhancing the mystery and suspense of the plot in the process. The best thing about Joon is that his style is the same. An entertaining presentation of  unique stories which compel the viewer to think.

"I think perhaps (western) people who are watching this movie who don&#39;t know anything about Korean culture, watch a lot of Korean dramas or shows be disadvantaged at getting references will miss is that the show is unmistakably Korean through and through. The faking culture, faking schooling, lying, flexing (rich) culture, stereotypical perceptions that Koreans have, like of foreigners, americans, American &quot;indians&quot;. The poor family is poor, you can tell, the main son uses I think an Lg g3 or g4? Pretty old phone in 2018/19. Which wouldn&#39;t feel right to be an LG ad promoting such an old phone so it more of a plot device rather than coincidental ad. The other family clearly has an iphone x since they are rich. The guy also uses cheap chinese binoculars towards the end, I know since have the same probably $10 binocular, showing that he&#39;s poor.

The moral to the story was society is structurally inequitable. Confucianism tells people to submit to social strictures in order to reap the benefits of a harmonious society.

"This is indeed a very nice movie, but in my opinion there is one major flaw. The fact that they are extremely smart and talented yet they somehow ended up leaving in a basement didn&#39;t make any sense at all. Not saying that there aren&#39;t any smart/talented people in the world that leave like this, quite the opposite... But most of them will have a reason for ending up like that. e.g. health issues, injustice, luck, etc... The poor family in this movie is basically portrayed as a bunch of lazy freeloaders, which makes you feel nothing about them...",Flex,2019-11-19T08:26:53Z,0

"Some things I noticed/learned about the move.  Spoiler alert<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>First:<br>Someone commented how unrealistic that the rich family never noticed the sliding door (with metal track on floor visible) that reveals the path down.<br><br><br>And the rich couple don&#39;t notice the people hiding under the table.<br><br><br>The rich couple don&#39;t notice things under them, because they don&#39;t look down.  Consciously and unconsciously, they don&#39;t look down. They don&#39;t want to see/know/interact with what&#39;s under them, because it makes them uncomfortable, vulnerable, etc. That&#39;s a line the rich couple don&#39;t want to cross down.<br><br><br>But the poor are always looking up. The poor family looking out the widow from the semibasement home. Looking up the steep path/stairs going up as they head to the rich family&#39;s home. <br><br><br><br>Second:<br>Also, the large window in the rich family&#39;s living room has the ratio of 21:9.

Goddamn man what took you so long to review this?!? I&#39;d been looking forward to this for almost a year so when I found out this was showing like 100 miles away from me at an Alamo draft house a couple of weeks ago I was like we&#39;re going their for the weekend lol.

"<b>Spoilers ahead</b><br><br><br><br>1) GEUN-SAE sends an S.O.S. message in morse code. DA-SONG sees it from his tent in the garden and writes it down... but that never comes into play. What was the point?<br>2) KI-TAEK stabs MR. PARK because he covered his nose. Before, KI-TAEK noticed the PARKS reacting that way to him. Like there was a &quot;poor people&quot; smell. They&#39;re both fathers who have to help their children, yet MR. PARK still thinks something as shallow as the smell is something to be concerned about during an emergency. Also, early on, DA-SONG was sniffing the KIMS and said &quot;They have the same smell.&quot; The KIMS took him as him noticing that they eat the same food or that they use the same detergent. However, in retrospective, it could be a hint that DA-SONG is somehow learning from his parents to tell rich and poor people apart.

"Just saw it. I was really looking forward to this but ended up a little disappointed with it. <br>Without giving away too many spoilers, I’ll just say everything involving the basement just took me out of the story. Started to feel unrealistic. <br>I think it’s partly because the initial setup is already stretching realism slightly but walking the tightrope just right and is really entertaining. Then they throw in that twist that tips it to the side. Characters make decisions that they should realize won’t better their position. Also, there started to be a lot of exposition at this point. <br>If I were to grade it, I’d give it a B+. Still a great movie, just not as much as I expected. Definitely got me thinking.<br>Maybe I’ll like it more if I see it again.",Profound Rambler,2019-11-08T09:14:05Z,1

"I didn&#39;t know what to expect from this movie. The trailer told me just enough to draw interest without giving too much (if anything) away. I couldn&#39;t even get a read on what genre or genres it might fall into.<br><br>With almost every line, I was more intrigued at the plot, invested in the cast, engrossed in the world, and impacted by the atmosphere. The pacing felt perfect from scene to scene, minute to minute.<br><br>Not one character felt unnecessary, and I never felt like I was being hand-held through anything such as with exposition. As the story &amp; tone shifted, my enjoyment went from laughing to being disturbed.<br><br>My first thought was &quot;WTF? Is this actually a horror/thriller? A dark satire? A black comedy? What&#39;s going on here?&quot; I can&#39;t explain it without spoilers, but compare it to <b>Doki Doki Literature Club&#39;s</b> twist.<br><br>My reaction was very similar (albeit, more sudden) the first time I went through that game. Anybody who&#39;s played knows exactly what I&#39;m talking about and remembers how THAT scene affected them. <br><br>Everything takes a tonal 180 and only escalates from there. <b>Parasite&#39;s</b> twist wasn&#39;t as immediate or in-your-face, but definitely every bit as surprising in the best way. It&#39;s an absolute masterpiece imo.",JUST ME,2019-11-08T04:00:18Z,1

"The meaning of parasite(Both the rich and the poor are parasites!!)<br>  - There are two meanings<br>1) infiltrate : the poor(Gitak&#39;s family and the basement family) infiltrate their money and place. And also the rich(Park&#39;s family) also infiltrate the poor and suck up their labors.<br>2) aversion(abhorrence): We generally abhor the parasite. If the rich and the poor don&#39;t respect each other, there are possibility for them to abhor each other because of various reasons. The limitation of Capitalism is that the gap between the rich and the poor is widening. The poor&#39;s deprivation and the rich&#39;s ignorance toward the poor can come into &quot;conflict&quot;. <br>It means that the rich regard the poor as parasites and vice versa. <br>These days, One&#39;s effort can not lessen the gap between the rich and the poor. But it is possible the rich to harmonize with the poor and vice versa. <br>If the rich only think that there is a invisible line, the conflict can not be solved.<br>is it possible the rich and the poor become real friends at each other?  How about trying to understand each other, and how about giving consideration and respect toward each other? <br>Then our world - The world of capitalism - can coexist between the two, and we should try not to make a world where the rich and the poor abhor each other.<br>In other words, Don&#39;t regard each other as a Parasite!! It only accelerates the demerit of Capitalism.<br><br><br>This is why the title of this film is parasite.",메가도스,2019-11-07T14:34:28Z,0

"The most wonderful part of this movie is the fate and decisions making at the end. It’s way more than just about the wealthy and poor problem of the society. It’s a reflection of good and evil, hatred and love. The richer may dislike the poor but at the end, when the poors actually is the one that wanted to kill the poor, and then the other poor instead of taking his revenge on the poor, instead he turned to the rich. And then probably the best human being died but the most evil one survived but remain being tortured. That, is the most beautiful ending you will see.",Jimmy Dance,2019-11-07T14:22:45Z,0

"I&#39;ve known NOTHING about this, other than &quot;It&#39;s Horror&quot; and &quot;It&#39;s Asian&quot;, and that alone, is good enough for one of my friends, who is REALLY into this stuff, and says that, if you only watch 80&#39;s slasher flicks, you&#39;re not ready for something like, say, Martyrs (sp?). I&#39;ve heard <b>of</b> Martyrs, from this friend, and I get that Japanese horror flicks are not for the casual western viewer, who only knows Freddy, Jason, Pennywise, the Xenomorph, the Terminator, the Predator, etc. It&#39;s a big leap from the 80&#39;s action/horror cliches, to the whole world of Japanese horror, especially the less commercial stuff. And I totally get the fear of jumping from &quot;Generic 80&#39;s blockbuster horror&quot; to &quot;Japanese stuff you definitely haven&#39;t heard of before, trust me, it&#39;s sick&quot; (and that Joss Whedon had some stuff from The Ring and some of that Eastern Horror featured in Cabin In The Woods, as just a taste of what &quot;Eastern Horror&quot; has in store&quot;. I haven&#39;t really seen anything in that Eastern Horror section.  But. If I were to find myself wanting more, I think something like Parasite, from what I <b>have</b> heard, it does sound like a good &quot;gateway drug&quot; into this area in horror movies. <br><br><br>And reviewers, critics, and the like, who I already subscribe to, saying that this is GOOD, is definitely something to take seriously. I have seen that, from just a &quot;brief glance&quot;, critics saying &quot;Parasite is a good, Asian horror movie&quot; around the board, is enough to get my attention. <br><br><br>Maybe I&#39;ll see it, when I think I&#39;m brave enough. Horror movies aren&#39;t my first choice. I&#39;m more &quot;Epic, badass, sci-fi/fantasy&quot; or &quot;real, poignant drama&quot; as a viewer, than I am a &quot;I wanna get my kicks on horror flicks&quot; kind of viewer. I&#39;ve never really loved horror movies. Some are awful, some are too much to deal with, I could really use a guide, etc etc. But I do hear that Parasite is good, from multiple voices around me (wow, that could be interpreted wrong!) so I may check this out.

"I usually get skeptical when a movie wins the Palme d&#39;Our. Sometimes there&#39;s really good movies that win the award and sometimes there are movies that are... well, at least not for me. But I recently watched Parasite and I think it&#39;s one of the best movies I&#39;ve seen in a long time. This might be one of my all-time favorite foreign movies. I think this is the kind of movie that critics and regular moviegoers can love because it&#39;s not too artsy and ambiguous for the regular moviegoer and it&#39;s not too &quot;mainstream&quot; for critics and deals with themes that a lot of people can identify with. Even though Endgame might be my favorite from this year, this is a very close second.

"Saw this film days ago and I echo every sentiment. I fucking loved everything about it. I tend to understand how some people might find even excellent films kinda boring because there&#39;s some truth to it where even high art films don&#39;t always aim to entertain the average viewer because it requires more investment and it prioritizes delivering a message or a unique experience more than it does to just entertain. But I honestly cannot imagine anyone finding this boring even if it is up there in excellence because it&#39;s made in a way where it&#39;s able to cater even to the most casual of tastes given its really entertaining nature and inviting cinematography. The dialogue doesn&#39;t go out of its way to be vague and complicated. Everything they say in here is exactly what a regular person would say but used in ways that serve the scenes extremely well. Man, I could talk about this film all day but this review nails the best parts of it well. Everyone must watch this film.",Benyamin Lorit,2019-11-07T07:49:02Z,52

"docsamson198 I agree. I didn’t know what to expect as I didn’t see any trailers or read reviews. I just kept seeing so much praised heaped on it so I had some free time and went to the cinema down the street. I was totally expecting a serious drama about a lower class family and their struggles. I was not expecting such a lighthearted, smart, and funny film. The pacing of the film zips by for the first half. There’s so much to love about how the story plays out that when the reveal happens that introduces the next story arc, I was completely surprised by it. <br><br>It still managed to be funny, but with darker undertones, and it gradually became a tragedy only to shift into another stylistic tone. And it executed it so well without it seeming forced or gimmicky. I think this merging of tones is a welcomed surprise for western audiences who may normally think of foreign films as high brow, intellectually stimulating but otherwise boring movies. This felt modern, quick, smart, clever, and it pulls off something very tricky—not taking itself so seriously but also not being frivolous and empty. I think it truly rewards the viewer and shows how filmmakers can tell engaging, sharp stories in new ways that still feel somewhat grounded in the familiar. Very enjoyable film. One I’d like to see again.",D Escalade,2019-11-07T15:48:26Z,11

"Stuckmann is great because he doesn&#39;t use his channel to milk every movie for every possible view he can get.  Unlike other movie critic channels which all do their same shit.  Every big movie release they will do videos for all of the following:  trailer reaction, movie review (no spoilers), movie spoiler talk,  movie ending explained,  movie box office numbers,  ideas for movie sequel, among others.   Chris just makes one video which is his movie review and moves on.  And yet, he manages to have over 1.5M subscribers.  No milking required!",Curt Randall,2019-11-07T04:00:16Z,0

Chris please watch more Korean shows and movies. This will help you see new constants in Korean culture that shows up all the time. How some of the symbols from visuals have deeper meaning in the culture that we don’t understand. Plus it might help you recognize some of the famous people that cameo in these films. (Min’s character) That’s why I recommend Strangers a from Hell which is a new show. It’s gritty and would never be done here. Please watch it.,paradoxchild01,2019-11-07T01:17:48Z,0

"I was actually formulating a story similar to this months ago I even realized Parasite existed, now I feel angry because I feel as if I&#39;m copying this man 💀, the synopsis I&#39;ve wrote for my story though reads, &quot; A man envys a younger man who has a successful job, a man who is better. The main message is to show the possible envy generations feel about one another, the resentment the disgust, a poor man envies a rich man kinda deal&quot; oh and its called, The Breath That Stinks. Give me a few years bois I&#39;ll make this damn thing, and I&#39;ve even written a scene where the son from the rich family walks from his house to school and you get to see the area change and get worse as a WAY TO SHOW THE CONTRAST BETWEEN BOTH GOD DAMN WORLDS FUCK",merdemoiii -,2019-11-06T21:44:45Z,0

"I haven&#39;t seen Lighthouse yet, so I cannot comment on that. This year, I was waiting for parasite to be released as soon as I heard that Bong Joon Ho was directing it. I had humongous expectation. I watched movies like Us, Joker, endgame, Midsomer.., but something was missing in all these movies, even though they all are really good movies. But, Parasite completed my cinema viewing experience this year. On the first viewing, without having any knowledge about the movie, I was blown away. Like if you have big expectation, even though the movie is good, it can bring down your experience with the movie. But its not that case here.  It is undoubtedly the best movie this year. On the second viewing, I can safely say that this is a masterpiece. The story, direction, acting, cinematography, everything is great. Every dialogue, every scene, every object in the movie is meaningful in its own way. I highly recommend people to watch this movie.",sabin bhandari,2019-11-06T20:59:01Z,0

"Hey Chris, serious question for a as a movie/film enthusiast. <br><br>Whats your thoughs on Martin Scorsese&#39;s views on the Marvel Cinematic Universe? Im very curious because i know you love many of the Marvel movies, even gave some of them an A+.

And we all agree on one thing. The set up was fantastic, the plot is brilliant. Script etc. But the ending or the plot twist, wasnt strong enough.

"Hmmm. I&#39;m slightly torn. I really enjoyed the film, but that mostly hinged on how the ending tied everything together. Everything that preceded it was an extremely well made suspenseful black comedy, but it felt slightly Coen Bros or Hitchcock lite at times. But that ending, without spoiling the film, was incredibly heartwarming when you consider everything that preceded it. It also had a good message that didn&#39;t feel cheap. I felt it had a better ending than Snowpiercer, and that&#39;s why it&#39;s the better film to me. All of his films are great, though.

The movie did a great job of building up to the ending but as you&#39;re expecting this explosive revelation, all you get pretty much is a wet fart. For me that dragged down the score but the acting, cinematography and most of the writing are on point. B+ for me.",jbrock11,2019-11-06T17:23:46Z,5

"I had a hard time getting super invested in this film because I didn&#39;t like any of the characters. I felt like they were all kind of shitty people doing heartless things and I didn&#39;t care what happened to any of them. So I found myself feeling something I almost ever feel during movies: boredom. Also I felt this movie lived between reality and fantasy in a way where it didn&#39;t really take advantage of either the emotion of relatability or the visceral experience of the fantastic. This movie moved past believability for me but didn&#39;t ever seen to take advantage of the strange reality it created. I will agree it was immaculately crafted, but I felt it was a bit sterile and forgettable. My grade: B",Nick Andrew,2019-11-06T17:22:54Z,0

"It is not that flawless because you do need to suspend disbelief that a poor family whose members can&#39;t find work can be that cunning to dupe a rich family.  They could have used their street smarts to find jobs or at least do several scams as a family.  If not for that friend who refers the tutor to this rich family, the poor family can&#39;t have gotten a foot in the door. That is my issue with the movie and since I am very familiar with Asian cinema as an Asian.  However, I am glad that Westerners are now enjoying the Asian flourish when it comes to cinema.

"I have been waiting for your review for the last 4 month ( we Asia get to view this film early). I have to say this is one of the most perfect film of the year not just the movie  as a whole but the message behind it is also very deep and you can see throughout the visual especially how many time that stairs is being used in this movie. It not just how their world is different but It representing how opposite this rich and poor like when you keep moving up the life and atmosphere become clearer and  more cheerful, and turn darker and hard to live the more you go down (Hence the toilet is the most highest place in the poor family house). And the term Parasite according to me is not just mean for the poor family but also the rich one and all the people in this movie.

"“Movies are back!” 2 A+ within a week?! <br><br>I have to say the backend of this year has had some pretty great films. First half of 2019 was weak, and I felt 2018 was weak personally. <br><br>2017 was it for me. Logan. Baby Driver. Blade Runner 2049. Guardians of the Galaxy 2. Thor Ragnarok. Kong Skull Island. It. Alien Covenant. Wind River. Hostiles. Spider-Man Homecoming. Kingsman 2. War for the Planet of the Apes. Dunkirk. Wonder Woman. Get Out. John Wick 2. Three Billboards. King Arthur. Shot Caller. American Made. Logan Lucky. A Monster Calls. Lost City of Z. Mother. Brawl in Cell Block 99. <br><br>So many more, a lot of other great indie films and lower profile ones too, those are just the big ones that come to mind. A year of great variety!<br><br>So it is good to have some good movies for the first time in a while! Great review as always Chris :)",D. EDITS,2019-11-06T16:34:53Z,2

"Nice review! I had hoped that you&#39;d get into &quot;Parasite&quot; as I am a person who loves South Korean cinema. Chris, I sincerely believe you should delve more deep into South Korean movies. For maybe more than 7-8 years, Korean movies have offered me what Hollywood rarely is able to give. I would say these days South Korean movie industry produces more better and well produced &quot;Hollywood movies&quot; than Hollywood itself.  I don&#39;t know if you read comments but if you do - I believe you will enjoy the next movies: &quot;Along with the Gods: The Two Worlds,&quot; &quot;Castaway on the Moon,&quot; &quot;The Thieves,&quot; &quot;A Hard Day&quot;, &quot;Sea Fog&quot;, &quot;The Chaser&quot;, &quot;The Wailing&quot;, &quot;Train to Busan&quot;.

"@Fathel That is your opinion. Here&#39;s mine: As much as I appreciate Roma&#39;s phenomenal accomplishments visually talking, Roma&#39;s actual story and story just feels more like a set up for the visuals rather than the core of the film. It does have some good moments in it, but at times the story itself doesn&#39;t overcome the limitations it has imposed. Whereas Parasite is brilliantly flawless in every single aspect. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I like Roma quite a bit (and it definitely should have won Best Picture instead of Green Book), I just think Parasite is a slightly more complete experience.",Emi Grant,2019-11-06T20:27:13Z,1

@Tero Heikkinen It is the case for America and Canada. I didn&#39;t want to presume that was the case for Europe. But for me I have to go two towns over just to find this or even the Lighthouse playing in theatres because they are limited releases. And I live in one of the more populated regions of Canada,Ash,2019-11-06T16:52:18Z,0
