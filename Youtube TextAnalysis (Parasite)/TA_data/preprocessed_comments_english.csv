"Reaganomics or Siphon Economics, which I like to call it, is NOT real Capitalism! To use an analogy, if Siphon Economics was a car. Then people arguing for it would say things like: If we just take more fuel out of the car. The car will go further and faster. Which any simpleton would understand was a false statement, but switch it to something they dont understand, aka macro economics, and they will be fooled.<br><br>This movie isnt anti capitalism. It is anti siphon economics. It is anti badly regulated capitalism.<br> Capitalism is not about &quot;greed&quot; or &quot;poverty&quot;, but it is about efficiency via fiat currency (money). How do you create a product with the least amount of input (raw materials, labor, power, transport etc). The measurement in this context for success is the bottom line because everything mentioned uses fiat currency to to pay for. The more money you make, the more efficient you are. However the negatives is that the more suksessfull you are, the more your out compete others. This creates less competition and in turn can also lead to lower quality products again, but it also creates wealth and leverage concentrations which in turn can damage the middle class and shrink it.<br><br>What keeps capitalism alive? Money? LoL, no. It is DEMAND. Who creates the most demand in a society? The middle class. You remove the middle class or shrink it. You will, adjusted for inflation, reduce the size of your nations economy over time unless it is just a low bar raw material export nation. In short, pushing policies that damages the middle class is bad for capitalism. Not taxes the most successful allot is bad for capitalism. Not splitting up &quot;to big to fail&quot; type companies (anti trust laws) is bad for capitalism. Too little or unenforced regulation is bad for capitalism.<br><br>Reaganomics, aka Siphon economics, are against any type of policies that would change capitalism to a better version that is also sustainable in the future. Reaganomics focus more on individual companies bottom line, they should get everything they want, at the cost of the nation, its citizens and global demand level. Which long term will LOWER economic activity, because in reality it is just siphoning wealth from the treasury (lower taxes, no corporate responsibility, offsetting costs of labor, environment and so on onto the government) and citizens (anti union or any other form of leverage, against worker rights and so on) in the name of short term profits.

"Yahshua - you know Him as Jesus - was born to a virgin, turned water to wine, taught, healed the sick, raised the dead, casted out demons, walked on water, calmed the storm, and fed a crowd of thousands with a few fish and a few loaves of bread, among many other things. He was killed on the cross as payment for the sins of all mankind, three days later He rose from the dead. Forty days later He ascended into heaven where He sits at the right hand of the Father. He is returning very soon, but before He does, Satan, the devil, is coming to pretend to be Jesus/God (2 Thessalonians 2:1-4). Satan is an angel, and he will have certain supernatural powers with which to try to fool everyone. He will, for example, be able to make fire come down from heaven in the sight of men. He will only be on earth a short time before the real King of Kings, Jesus Christ, God in the flesh, returns. When the real Jesus comes we will all be transformed into our spiritual bodies at the same moment. Jesus came in the flesh to offer forgiveness of sins and eternal life to anyone who believes and calls on His precious name!<br><br>if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. - Romans 10:9<br><br>Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat. But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste? For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor. When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me. For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always. For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial. Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her. - Matthew 26:6-13<br><br>Seek ye the LORD while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near: Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon....<br><br>To anoint your self, the sick, or a building for spiritual protection:<br>Get a small bottle of olive oil and pour off a small amount into a smaller vessel like a vial or baby food jar. Use the rest of the bottle for cooking. Ask the Lord to bless your vial of oil in Jesus name. Anoint yourself with the oil by placing a dab of oil on tip of finger and touch it to your forehead, and ask the Lord to bless you/heal you.

"This is an extremely delusional analysis. Moral ambiguity was not a significant characteristic of Parasite. I‚Äôm not sure what Bong-Joon-ho‚Äôs allegorical intentions were with the film but regardless, his movie does not succeed at painting the Parks (or capitalism) as any sort of villain, or presenting the poor families as victims. In fact it does the opposite.<br><br>Objectively, the Parks never actually do anything wrong. 1) They never actually know the poor family is poor (because they are impersonating middle/upper class workers), even up till the end of the movie when it is explicitly said that Yeon-kyo, the wife, didn‚Äôt understand why her driver killed her husband. This is relevant because it means their remarks about foul smells and boundaries, is not manifestation of class-based prejudice or superiority complex, but a professional expectation. Keep this fact in mind for my next points. 2) The parasite metaphor is inappropriate to describe the Parks. They apparently pay the family very well for their work as Min explicitly states to Ki-woo near the start‚Ä¶I can‚Äôt actually think of a single wrong thing the Parks do that cannot be truly explained as mischaracterizations potentially borne from the prejudice and resentment.<br><br>The poor family on the other hand have no shortage of guilt. 1) Ki-woo‚Äôs initial crime of forgery/fraud could be excused since it was masterminded by his friend, but he then assists his entire family to conspire and commit multiple acts of slander and fraud and even man slaughter. 2) The stone given to Ki-Woo by Min at the start is expensive as the director himself has stated. Rather than sell this stone or otherwise monetize it for income, Ki-Woo sees fit to use it as a murder weapon. 3) Kim Ki-take has no reason to be resentful of Yeon-kyo for her remarks about the rain being a blessing, she had no idea, nor could she ever have imagined that he and his family were suffering as a direct result. Besides, if the poor family had been at home eating their own food, bought with the money they now certainly had, rather than stealing food and alcohol from the Parks, they would apparently have saved their home from flooding. 4) The flooding of their home was also their fault, the had left the window open before and had had multiple warnings in the form of the drunk man to close their window. 5) Kim Ki-taek cannot hold against the Parks what they say in the privacy of their own home, without the knowledge they were being surveilled by (essentially) home invaders. 6) my final point is that Kim Ki-take shows no proactivity in ensuring that he as a husband and father provides for his family, the pizza box job is found by his wife, the Park jobs are sought out by his son and all the while he plays a passive role in seeking financial opportunities for his family, yet he has the audacity to fee emasculated/oppressed by another man‚Äôs comfort‚Ä¶<br><br>In light of these narrative details and more, it‚Äôs absurd that one would try to paint the main poor family as victims. While their circumstances are very sympathetic and unfortunate in many moments, they are also demonstrably covetous, reckless and criminally opportunistic.

"I enjoyed this video, but I feel like you‚Äôre forgetting a major component about your situation that should have been discussed. <br><br>To speak badly about the state of society is a privilege. Most people are just surviving. The average family of 5 has dad making $1000 a month worldwide. For most people, capitalism is not a question, it‚Äôs existence. Everyone at the bottom is hungry to get at the top. But when most westerns, living a comfortable life, think about that, they think pity those poor people. But what westerners really should be thinking about is fear. All westerners need to confront their fear about poorness.<br><br>Because you see, we are all complicit in making capitalism work. Almost every human alive. The average worldwide family makes 1k a year. Do you want to make $10,000 a year? You cannot say you disagree with capitalism if you don‚Äôt say yes to this. Some people might not know how far 10k gets you. Check Brazil out. The truth is, the moment you have more, the moment you will never want to give it up. So your answer is almost certainly yes. That makes you complicit. Welcome to the 99%.<br><br>Then we can agree that capitalism is a natural state of being. There is no world where western living becomes the norm in the next 100 years. It‚Äôs only if everyone is comfortable with giving up material wealth like Jesus that we can come to some semblance of communism. But that will never happen as long as people want more over others.<br><br>The truth is is that the best we can do is push for more socialist policies as capitalism grows. It‚Äôs easy to try to DISMANTLE capitalism, but it‚Äôs hard to actually BUILD a different kind of society, which is what I wish a lot of more people wisened up on. It‚Äôs so normalized to get angry over systems without understanding the system in a 360 lens, not just what you hate about it. Hate leads nowhere.<br><br>Lastly, the reason why I brought this up is because I feel like talking badly about capitalism without disclaiming you come from the upper end of capitalism makes you disingenuous.

Interesting film. But this doesn‚Äôt change the fact that it does not matter where you came from. You can live your dream life. Cause and effect are real. Follow the principles necessary to achieve your goals and you will be successful. One does not become wealthy. One first becomes a certain type of person and then wealth is a product of that change. Not the other way around. There‚Äôs a reason the wealthy separate them selves. Because they observed this fact and acted on it while others either did not see it or did not act. Either way this creates a major disconnect because the poor won‚Äôt ever be able to understand why you do what you do unless they themselves switch their mindset. These films always show rich wealthy people just living life. Never show the story of how they got the money. Because believe it or not majority of millionaires are self made. Meaning they did not receive an inheritance. And the story of how they got it will show you everything you need to know about why they separate themself from the poor.,interesting film change fact matter came live dream life cause effect real follow principles necessary achieve goals successful one become wealthy one first becomes certain type person wealth product change way around reason wealthy separate selves observed fact acted others either see act either way creates major disconnect poor ever able understand unless switch mindset films always show rich wealthy people living life never show story got money believe majority millionaires self made meaning receive inheritance story got show everything need know separate themself poor,positive

Any new system you invent will still have motivated individuals with high productivity vs lower productivity, the highly motivated highly productive individuals will find new ways to rise to the top. The thing is, this is just as natural as anything else in the universe, it follows power-laws. <br><br>My father was a poor worker just like the ones you speak about, he however, worked hard and put me through school and saved up money for my higher education because he didn&#39;t want me to be like him, he succeeded, he is the best dad in the world for me, I&#39;ll always be grateful to him and his sacrifices. The point I&#39;m trying to make is, in America, familial connections or sacrifice for family member is unheard of, their value system is so hollow that they have to find something external to blame for their predicament. <br><br>All of these rich-poor arrangements are exactly the same, they peak and break down and a new one will take its place.

"I feel like the people in the comments section are kind of misguided. Everyone‚Äôs being all pessimistic. Of course many of us in the comments section will never be apart of the 1 percent. Hell most of us won‚Äôt even be in the top 15 percent of wealth? But when was any of that ever a requirement to live a happy and fulfilling life? How many ludicrously wealthy and successful people have been found suicidal or found overdosed on drugs? Life is a game. But the main objective is not to have the biggest house, or the most accolades or the nicest car. Many people have reached those ‚Äúachievements‚Äù and they still don‚Äôt feel like they‚Äôve won the game. The main objective is to find honest, pure and genuine contentment. You find that and you can walk around like a bad-ass confident bitch anywhere you go. <br><br>What I liked about parasite (and this awesome video essay) was how versatile it is. As a middle class American, I always found it mind riveting how there were scenes where I related to the Kims, but conversely there were also parts where the bougie-ass family was more relatable. Nothing in this life is black and white. And it shouldn‚Äôt be seen in such a dire light 24/7. <br><br>We always pity those really destitute people on the margins. People in war torn countries living in UN assisted camps, people forced to work in sweatshops, homeless people who have no where to sit because park benches are spiky, children and mothers in developing nations who walk a mile for the nearest clean water. We, the privileged people on the Internet, who are sitting safely within a sheltered home with secure enough connection to even see this video, should also be ashamed of reflecting onto the people who are truly on the margins of society. <br><br>It‚Äôs such a typical first world thing to say ‚Äúoh poor homeless man‚Äù Or ‚Äúoh poor person in developing country, let me hastily donate eighty dollars to appease my conscience‚Äù...but if we were to actually come into contact with those on the real fringes of society and speak to them, they‚Äôd tell you they‚Äôre either content with their situation or that it‚Äôs not as bad as it seems. And they‚Äôre probably being honest. Think about it. If being ‚Äúpoor‚Äù (because wealth as a concept is relative) is all one ever knows they‚Äôre not gonna mind. Speaking from personal experience, my first few years of life were characterized by me living in a two bedroom apartment only a couple miles away from the US-Mexican border in southern Cali. The fire hydrant as a water park, clothes from Walmart, spaghetti almost every dinner, the Disney channel being a privilege at our more well-off relative‚Äôs house and eating at McDonald‚Äôs as special occasions were all I knew. But damn I was content because it was all I knew. And then my dad actually did get a promotion at work, my family relocated to the east and we lived a relatively stable life. Hell, I even went through tuition based Catholic schooling from the time I was in 1st grade all the way up til senior year. How‚Äôs that for upward mobility not being possible? <br><br>I just, I admire this video essay, but the defeatist and pessimistic attitude people have in the comments section is very frustrating. Life is not as rigid as we would like to believe it to be. It‚Äôs just not enough people (especially those in the middle) have enough gusto to work for it. Also, Im not a boomer, I‚Äôm Gen Z and I can see why older generations call us a whiny generation. Yes, the economy these days is way more complicated than what it was say 50 years ago....the job market is over saturated but it‚Äôs not a starkly unfair, or unyielding situation..we literally have the whole ass internet to serve as a walking living breathing business card for employers. <br><br>Sure, that main dude in parasite will probably never have enough in his lifetime to afford the Park house? But why look at the situation that way? I think the movie ends on an optimistic note regardless. Because even if he‚Äôll never buy the house, by the end of the movie he‚Äôs in a much better position then he was at the beginning. He has a goal...to work and improve his situation. It won‚Äôt be a lavish, beautiful house but what I love about the ending is that you can interpret as you want. <br><br>Even during the scene where he‚Äôs talking to his dad in the gymnasium. Its been a year since I last saw it but there‚Äôs a scene where he tells his dad how he wants to do better. He wants to work hard (and i think he even mentions going back to school?) Both of the families were bad in their own way. Just because they were on the fringes of society, that didn‚Äôt excuse their continual exploitation of the wealthy family. And of course nothing excused the rich family‚Äôs treatment towards the poor family. <br>We shouldn‚Äôt under scrutinize people because they‚Äôre poor, we shouldn‚Äôt over scrutinize people because they‚Äôre rich. Classism is classism no matter how it manifests. <br><br>It‚Äôs reality. A poor person can improve their situation. can a homeless man on the street become the next Jeff bezos in the same lifetime? No. But whose to say he even wants to be as wealthy as Jeff bezos. To him just living in an apartment with running water is lavish enough for him. Yes, most of us in this comment section will never be in the 1 percent. But by prioritizing that goal, aren‚Äôt we just perpetuating the same game capitalism aims to set? <br><br>Here‚Äôs my interpretation of the ending...the protagonist goes back to school, gets a job, saves enough to bail out his dad, gets a decent house that can <b>comfortably</b> hold both his parents and himself. They don‚Äôt have to deal with fumigators treating them like pesticides anymore. Bingo bongo and that‚Äôs on the capitalist dream. Upward economic mobility is still a very real possibility. Its just not as needed for most people who can sit comfortably behind a computer screen all day. <br><br>In fact, I‚Äôd even wager that the reason we see Ki-woo buying the house at the end was to help us the audience relate to Ki-woo‚Äôs ambitions more. For us, the class of people who don‚Äôt need to work all day, we have the privilege of getting to watch film and critique it. And i bet the director or whoever put the scene in knew a majority of the audience would be middle class. If im correct, I don‚Äôt even think Ki-woo states that he wants to buy the house, his main ambition is to simply make enough to save his dad and improve his situation. But they paired it with the visual imagery of him getting the bougie house because it‚Äôd connect more with the mainstream audience, us,,,the middle class. Because a majority of the viewers would be elated to get sweet digs like that. We‚Äôd be as elated as Ki-woo would be to both simply just leave the flooded parasite den and rescue his father. Emphasis on simply leaving. He doesn‚Äôt want to be the next Park family. My interpretation is he simply wants to improve rather than be a parasite the rest of his life. Because upward mobility, no matter how small or grand, is still and always is possible. :)",feel like people comments section kind misguided everyone pessimistic course many comments section never apart percent hell even top percent wealth ever requirement live happy fulfilling life many ludicrously wealthy successful people found suicidal found overdosed drugs life game main objective biggest house accolades nicest car many people reached achievements still feel like game main objective find honest pure genuine contentment find walk around like bad ass confident bitch anywhere liked parasite awesome video essay versatile middle class american always found mind riveting scenes related kims conversely also parts bougie ass family relatable nothing life black white seen dire light always pity really destitute people margins people war torn countries living assisted camps people forced work sweatshops homeless people sit park benches spiky children mothers developing nations walk mile nearest clean water privileged people internet sitting safely within sheltered home secure enough connection even see video also ashamed reflecting onto people truly margins society typical first world thing say poor homeless man poor person developing country let hastily donate eighty dollars appease conscience actually come contact real fringes society speak tell either content situation bad seems probably honest think poor wealth concept relative one ever knows gon mind speaking personal experience first years life characterized living two bedroom apartment couple miles away mexican border southern cali fire hydrant water park clothes walmart spaghetti almost every dinner disney channel privilege well relative house eating mcdonald special occasions knew damn content knew dad actually get promotion work family relocated east lived relatively stable life hell even went tuition based catholic schooling time grade way til senior year upward mobility possible admire video essay defeatist pessimistic attitude people comments section frustrating life rigid would like believe enough people especially middle enough gusto work also boomer gen see older generations call whiny generation yes economy days way complicated say years ago job market saturated starkly unfair unyielding situation literally whole ass internet serve walking living breathing business card employers sure main dude parasite probably never enough lifetime afford park house look situation way think movie ends optimistic note regardless even never buy house end movie much better position beginning goal work improve situation lavish beautiful house love ending interpret want even scene talking dad gymnasium year since last saw scene tells dad wants better wants work hard think even mentions going back school families bad way fringes society excuse continual exploitation wealthy family course nothing excused rich family treatment towards poor family scrutinize people poor scrutinize people rich classism classism matter manifests reality poor person improve situation homeless man street become next jeff bezos lifetime whose say even wants wealthy jeff bezos living apartment running water lavish enough yes comment section never percent prioritizing goal perpetuating game capitalism aims set interpretation ending protagonist goes back school gets job saves enough bail dad gets decent house comfortably hold parents deal fumigators treating like pesticides anymore bingo bongo capitalist dream upward economic mobility still real possibility needed people sit comfortably behind computer screen day fact even wager reason see woo buying house end help audience relate woo ambitions class people need work day privilege getting watch film critique bet director whoever put scene knew majority audience would middle class correct even think woo states wants buy house main ambition simply make enough save dad improve situation paired visual imagery getting bougie house connect mainstream audience middle class majority viewers would elated get sweet digs like elated woo would simply leave flooded parasite den rescue father emphasis simply leaving want next park family interpretation simply wants improve rather parasite rest life upward mobility matter small grand still always possible,positive

"@Gao Ai Bai  <br>I replayed some of your link at 50% speed where I can compare the lyrics with the transliteration, at full speed it is too fast for someone who doesnt know korean. The truth is I dont know much about korea, but I have noticed similarities with indian things when watching korean films, which I dont see with say japanese things.<br><br>what I am referring to is before the islamic conquest of India, and that islamic conquest of India in fact originates from Genghis Khan, eg shah Jahan who created the Taj Mahal claimed to be descended from Genghis. He ruled from 1628 to 1658 and was the 5th emperor from the Mogul dynasty. I think &quot;mogul&quot; is probably an indian transliteration of mongol, sometimes also transliterated as mughal.<br><br>I am talking of conquests from much further back in time, eg there was hinduism in Cambodia, eg the Angkor Wat temple complex was &quot;hindu&quot;, which was built 1113 to  1150AD.<br><br><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angkor_Wat"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angkor_Wat</a><br><br>it began as hindu and eventually was converted to buddhist.<br><br>The word &quot;hindu&quot; is itself an externally applied idea, in fact it is a spiritual culture and not a centrally controlled religion, which includes diverse beliefs and traditions, including non religious things such as medicine, astronomy, mathematics, surgery, etc.<br><br>There was also spiritual expansion from India, in particular buddhism which reached China and Japan. Before buddhism a lot of the far east was in continual war, whereas buddhism brought in a more peaceful attitude via concepts such as karma and also non injury (ahimsa) and united different nations via a common religion.<br><br>I think some of the indian conquest was peaceful via royals intermarrying, namely the legend you mention and the indian prince marrying a thai princess to found the modern thai royal family. The legend you mention sounds right, and would explain the similarities. Koreans arent just going to invent such a specific legend which also conforms with what was happening in other countries.<br><br>In europe also, there was expansion via royal marriage, where maybe they became allies rather than a conquest. eg Scotland got united with England via royal marriage, England was unable to defeat Scotland by war.<br><br>Modern history tends to be that broadcast by europe, especially England and Germany, but all that had to conform with the anglican and lutheran churches respectively, which said creation was 6000 years ago, and which will always dismiss any non christian accomplishments.<br><br>But with indian scriptures, they used an astronomical calender, and would give the date via the stars and planets, and because of the precession of the equinoxes, certain seasonal things gradually change with time, and indian scholars have been able to date scriptural references via the precession of the equinoces far further back than western historians give, where western history says nothing happened before some 6000 years ago. <br><br>the sanskrit language in particular is the most advanced human language ever, and is beyond the scope of most humans to speak,<br>the only people who can handle it adeptly are the brahmin priest caste of hinduism. Western scholars struggle with the language, and have to consult brahmins for whom the language is matter of fact.<br><br>And all the major languages of europe appear to be descended from sanskrit, including latin and greek. <br><br>Only languages such as hungarian + finnish, and basque are unrelated, hungarian + finnish + turkish are closely related and relate to Genghis Khan&#39;s mongol hordes, and are agglutinative languages (based on successive suffices) as are the red indian languages.<br>whereas sanskrit is vastly more sophisticated, similar to latin, but with much more structure than latin. Latin is a degenerated form of sanskrit.<br><br>europeans have then tried to deny this indian basis by looking for a PIE (proto indo european) language as a conjectured precursor for sanskrit, but there is no evidence for this conjecture EXCEPT sanskrit! Ultimately indus valley was THE original civilisation and the origin of sanskrit.<br><br>when the germans discovered that sanskrit was the root of even latin and greek, they became obsessed with sanskrit civilisation and began scouring India for everything relating to this, and did intense study, in particular the philosophy which ultimately led to german philosophy. All german academics would study the indian scriptures, eg the upanishads and gita. When Oppenheimer exploded the first atom bomb, he quoted from the hindu scriptures about &quot;I am become the destroyer of worlds&quot;. To quote like that is only possible if he had done intense study.<br><br>this study of sanskrit led to huge progress in Germany, the germans studied sanskrit civilisation then developed the ideas in their own direction.<br><br>in fact the chinese martial arts originate from the shaolin buddhist temples, where the monks were being taught yoga poses to show the mastery of the mind over the body. The chinese then developed this static practice into a dynamic practice for self defence. If you watch martial arts people, you will see they meditate briefly in a static pose before an explosion of violence. All physical action begins in the mind, and the more nerves you utilise the more power and control you get.<br><br>There is ginormous progress now in India, and India is closer to europe than all the far eastern countries. But they are nearer the US, the rise of China is partly because it is next door to the US. <br><br>chinese exports tend to be by ship otherwise too expensive, and these take a long time. Ships will reach europe quicker from India than from China, but chinese ships will reach the US faster. The US is ultimately a smaller market than Europe, the US is some 360 million people, europe is more than 540 million, and that excludes Russia. the population of India was 1.336 billion in 2019, so is larger than the EU + US combined and will soon overtake China which was 1.398  in 2019.<br><br>India has 2 advantages over the far eastern countries: nearer the bigger market of europe, and a better command of english. Far eastern people generally struggle with english, and also each far eastern country has a tricky language to learn. I wanted to email Samsung once, and it was impossible, the only portal was in the korean script!<br><br>western history will deny India and China any importance because they are non christian societies, it is religious prejudice.<br><br>but historically India was at the centre of the old world, and there was major trade by ship from India both to the far east and to arabia and the east african coast. Europe in fact was backward because it was more isolated from India for ships. europe was civilised by the romans, who were civilised by the greeks, but there is a lot of evidence that the greeks were civilised by their study of indian civilisation.<br>Greece originally was violent, then they came in contact with India via Alexander, and now became civilised.<br><br><br>european mathematics has its origins in India, where the greeks of Alexander the great brought the wisdom to the library at Alexandria in Egypt, and eg the decimal number system was an indian invention, which reached europe via the arabs. Before that it was roman numerals eg MCMLXXXIV instead of 1984. The concept of algorithm was from an arab Al kwarizmi, which he developed after studying the works of indian mathematics, which had the precursors. european steelmaking also has its origins in India, where the finest steel was indian, and famous british physicist Michael Faraday was assigned to reverse engineer it. But he was unable to, and they had to eventually use espionage to find how the indians made it. <br><br><a href=""https://www.currentscience.ac.in/Volumes/113/09/1792.pdf"">https://www.currentscience.ac.in/Volumes/113/09/1792.pdf</a><br><br>The ancient indians had a huge suite of surgical instruments, which needs quality steel, &quot;surgical steel&quot; and invented cataract surgery. Plastic surgery was another indian invention, where indians were doing nose transplants, and knew what herbs and oils to use to prevent the flesh getting infected. Europeans took the idea and renamed it with a latin name, rhinoplasty which makes it seem to be a european idea!<br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIuKuYZ-bd8"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIuKuYZ-bd8</a><br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGyjvyXEKdc&amp;t=5351s"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGyjvyXEKdc&amp;t=5351s</a><br><br>according to western history the oldest civilisations are Sumer and Indus, and Indus was far bigger than Sumer.

"@Gao Ai Bai <br><br>I have looked at your link, and the link does give your version in the text, but it does sound like dekho, but this seems to be a coincidence. S J Call seems to be bracketed for some reason, why do they say (S J Call) and not S J Call?<br><br>the transliteration of the korean looks very non chinese, the sound of the korean language also is totally different from chinese,<br>the sound flows quite smoothly, whereas chinese is like a series of erratic explosions.<br><br>I meant indochina in a general sense of major indian influence and also genetics. Where typically some aspects of the people relate to the chinese race, and some aspects relate to the indians. <br><br>eg I watched some other korean film, and they were using astrological things just like the indians do.<br><br>technically Nepal isnt part of Indochina, but if you look at the gurkha language, it is closely related to hindi.<br>so for me Nepal IS part of my definition of indochina.<br><br>the tibetans also use the sanskrit script for their non indian language and follow the buddhist religion which is from India.<br>and I would regard them as indochinese.<br><br>technically also Burma isnt part of Indochina, but for me Burma is part of indochina, you have only to look at the skin colour of the burmese, who often are dark skinned. Some are light skinned, some dark.<br><br>the word indochina literally means indian china, the fact that the term has become precise to mean places under french rule, doesnt mean we have to be bound by someone else&#39;s interpretation of the word. eg historically India included Burma and Bangladesh, but today it doesnt, but you can include Burma in India if it suits your purpose provided you define what you mean, which might be different from what I mean.<br><br>eg some people regard &quot;african&quot; to mean anyone from Africa, but you could also mean just the negroid people.<br>a lot of the people of the mediterranean coast of Africa are of roman descent and you could argue are europeans.<br>Cleopatra herself was of greek descent. Are the boers africans or dutch or both or neither?<br><br>for some &quot;black&quot; means dark colour, but Meghan Markle looks completely white to me, but is classed as &quot;black&quot;.<br><br>the word India is anyway an externally applied word, the indians call their country Bharat. <br><br>officially Vietnam is part of Indochina, but India, Vietnam, China are 3 different countries, so the terminology is absurd if you are very literal. The vietnamese have their own language which at least sounds quite different from chinese or any indian language.<br>but some of them are dark people. <br><br>maybe you are korean and Korea is important to you, but for me it isnt important, and is one of many countries and is irrelevant except for Samsung and LG consumer electronics, the economic success of korea is because the americans have moved business their way to bolster it against communism. The americans hand a lot of business to South Korea and Taiwan, eg smartphone screens made by Samsung, and various PC hardware eg AMD cpus and motherboards made in Taiwan. Do you think the japanese arent capable of creating smartphones and PC hardware? But the business is handed to South Korea and Taiwan with a political motive. Because if they dont, the country will succumb to the north.<br><br>South Korea has a geographical problem that North Korea blocks it from the mainland of Asia, and Japan is nearby.<br><br>its success is artificial and is the charity of the US. It is successful for the same reason North Korea is unsuccessful, that China ensures North Korea is unsuccessful.<br><br>there is a lot of propaganda, the far eastern countries tend to be in denial of India,<br>you can see this blatant brainwashing in the film itself where they repeatedly associate the word &quot;indian&quot; with &quot;red indian&quot;,<br><br>eg the rich dad says something like &quot;my son is interested in indian culture&quot;, how someone can mean red indian I find crazy,<br>you have this ginormous country with more than a billion people called India, with adjective indian,<br>but no, indian means red indian! With the son in a teepee to underline this misdirection. red indian is an externally applied word,<br>the actual people call themselves sioux, comanche, mohican etc. I watched a film from Mongolia, and the mongolians in fact also use teepees!<br><br>where they are using pavlovian programming to make the south koreans think &quot;red indian&quot; when they hear the word &quot;indian&quot;.<br>and for all I know you are part of this brainwashing or are brainwashed.<br><br>do you know what brainwashing is?<br>do you know what propaganda is?<br>do you know what disinformation is?<br>do you know what misinformation is?<br>do you really think cinema is just innocent little stories?<br>do you think South Korea has no brainwashing? I can see huge amounts of brainwashing in the few south korean films I have watched.<br><br>did you know that to publish a film in most countries you have to put in some kind of messaging from a list,<br>otherwise the film wont get past the censor?<br><br>I ran into this problem when I visited Japan and talked of indian things to some japanese guy, and the guy thought I meant red indian! He didnt know what India was! The japanese will meticulously say the story of the buddha, yet are in denial of India! Even Mao&#39;s mother was a buddhist.<br><br>the fact is if you look at koreans you can see they arent pure chinese, and have an indian look. I would say they have a south indian genetic influence.<br><br>But I would have to learn the korean language to really evaluate the language, and DNA analysis to determine the genetics, I cannot take a korean&#39;s word, because there is so much brainwashing. History is twisted and warped to suit the opinions and biases of the historian and his financiers.<br><br>South Korea is a political front of the US, and North Korea a political front of China. Both countries are puppets. Cut the strings, and the puppets fall. The US is in serious financial jeopardy, so it may happen sooner than you think, like their pull out from Afghanistan. Charity begins at home as they say.<br><br>The parasite fim has major brainwashing, eg the guy in the bunker I think was taiwanese or something, I dont have the time to locate the specific nationality,  and his wife spoofs a north korean broadcast,<br>do you think this is just a bit of story? or do you think they might be trying to brainwash south koreans to despise taiwanese by falsely associating them with the north koreans.<br><br>when the taiwanese guy bows his head against the switches, I think that is to undermine the japanese obsession with bowing,<br>but via a korean pretending to be a taiwanese!<br><br>they also selected a very ugly man to depict the taiwanese, again to undermine the opinion of taiwanese.<br>That poor daughter also in real life has to be a rich girl!

"In my mind, the unfairness of capitalism comes with access to information. Capitalism has done me very well in my life, so in that respect, I may be biased, but I believe that you can put someone who knows about money, in the poorest part of the poorest country they could work their way out, but only with the knowledge acquired from the western world. If you swapped a rich person and poor person&#39;s money around, the previously rich person would catch up, and the now rich person would likely lose the money. If the world was to be truely capitalistic in the way that it is intended, information should be available everywhere for those that want it. With the internet, almost everyone in the western world has access to all the information that any one person could ever ask for, but in places like these, I can&#39;t say that I&#39;m sure that someone could make it out. Capitalism as a concept only works with equal opportunity, obviously equal opportunity will never be possible, luck will always be a factor no matter what, but the world can strive for a base level of equal opportunity, which is an efficient and well thought out education system for everyone that gives genuinely useful information to a child as they are growing up.

Will you save a single sweatshop worker from stubbing their toe at work? Probably not. So what if you were Steve Jobs? Maybe then you could summon inhuman strength to defy your nature and shut it all down, but the people you displace will just move over you and become you. If you&#39;re somewhere in the middle, like you probably are, you can keep most of what you have by giving to a charity that will squander your money in bureaucracy and greed, or you can throw away what you have by buying a gun to go kill your local rich person, and then the media will make it a tragedy, and despite everything it actually is one, and then it becomes fuel on the fire.

Other more &quot;European features&quot; being idealized, such as having a stronger or higher nose bridge etc, come from Asian people having more rounded and flatter facial features.

A person who owns a factory does not have to physically engage in the labor of producing goods in a factory, but they benefit from the profit generated from the labor they hire. <br><br>Capitalism itself, as a term, is incredibly vague, but it&#39;s typically defined as an economic system where productive property can be owned in private hands. People who criticize capitalism tend to take a Marxist perspective, so they believe that the very act of profit is exploitative because it means you&#39;re &quot;stealing&quot; surplus value that is generated by a worker. The problem with such an analysis is that it uses what is called the &quot;labor theory of value&quot; when in reality the value of commodities is completely subjective. There is a lot to this, so I won&#39;t write a whole book in this comment section, but feel free to ask further questions if you have them.<br><br>I&#39;ll just leave you with a simple example to give you an idea of what I mean. A typical critic of capitalism would look at a clothing factory in a poorer country like India or Bangladesh and say &quot;Hey, the business owner is exploiting these poor people and paying them a low wage&quot; First of all I would invite this individual to look at GDP per capita data in Bangladesh and India, to see that they&#39;re becoming richer by the year thanks for foreign investment, but I&#39;d also put in in perspective. Imagine you live in a poor area with no job opportunities, and the only real option for you is subsistence farming. If someone from a foreign country decides to invest money to build a factory in your town and offer to pay people to work there - that is an absolute gain to everyone involved. The poor people in the town now have access to a job that didn&#39;t exist before, that pays more than subsistence farming, and the factory owner gets access to a labor market that is likely cheaper than in their home market - meaning people in their home country will have access to less expensive clothing - it&#39;s a win all around. This is associated with the economics principle of &quot;comparative advantage&quot;.<br><br>Anyway, that&#39;s what I&#39;d say for now on the matter. Most of the people who say things like that either haven&#39;t seriously seen the faults in marxist theory, or are frankly just jealous of people who are successful and generally worked hard to get to where they are (80+% of American millionaires are self-made)",jack middleton say people say tend take cursory look state see poor town poor area make short sighted conclusions idea capitalism quot requires quot thrives poor people accurate one logic claim capitalism requires dynamic ownership class working class person owns factory physically engage labor producing goods factory benefit profit generated labor hire capitalism term incredibly vague typically defined economic system productive property owned private hands people criticize capitalism tend take marxist perspective believe act profit exploitative means quot stealing quot surplus value generated worker problem analysis uses called quot labor theory value quot reality value commodities completely subjective lot write whole book comment section feel free ask questions leave simple example give idea mean typical critic capitalism would look clothing factory poorer country like india bangladesh say quot hey business owner exploiting poor people paying low wage quot first would invite individual look gdp per capita data bangladesh india see becoming richer year thanks foreign investment also put perspective imagine live poor area job opportunities real option subsistence farming someone foreign country decides invest money build factory town offer pay people work absolute gain everyone involved poor people town access job exist pays subsistence farming factory owner gets access labor market likely cheaper home market meaning people home country access less expensive clothing win around associated economics principle quot comparative advantage quot anyway say matter people say things like either seriously seen faults marxist theory frankly jealous people successful generally worked hard get american millionaires self made,positive

"I never saw anyone point out about that one scene in the beginning where the family was folding pizza boxes.

In the end they 1 out of 4 boxes were rejects. I feel like it&#39;s a metaphor how they chose the easier path to be employed. They built a tower of lies. The father symbolizes the whole family, the box symbolizes their life and current social status while the video symbolizes as their goal to escape poverty. They did not care what will happen if something would go wrong they kept lying to the park family thinking that they&#39;ll never be discovered. They didn&#39;t give a single care if they&#39;re doing something wrong.

"I agree with most of what was said in this video. Except one of the major points that was made. You stated that it is not really an option for the poor to aspire to having wealth and becoming rich, but this is simply untrue for millions of poor people. My father was a part of the lower class in my country (not in North America, Europe or any developed country by the way) growing up with what was necessary to live a life without physical suffering, but he never had more than enough and he had to come out of a town which had high crime rates. Today my dad is wealthy and owns his own companies. You try to say as a fact that coming out of poverty and that the American dream is just a lie sold to the people, but for millions across the world, and definitely for South Korea since it is a moderately developed country, it is indeed possible to become rich and to create wealth. If a child decides to do the best they can in school (if the opportunity is granted to them) they would generally be capable of going to college if they excel in their studies during highschool, and I don&#39;t say this baselessly. Even in my country if a kid graduates from his/her highschool with exemplary results they are capable of going to college which would allow them to generate money in a variety of ways. Not just this, but 88% percent of millionaires today are self-made and 80% of millionaires reported starting out with nothing. It may take Ki-woo nearly 600 years to come up with the money he needs to buy the house, but that doesn&#39;t take into account what it is that he does for a living or the potential he has doing something else. Some people are luckier than others when it comes to where they are born, but for most of us, with hard work, WE CAN DO ANYTHING! If you read all the way to here, don&#39;t let this video tell you that the American Dream is just an illusion and that there isn&#39;t any way for you to build wealth and become rich.

The Parks don&#39;t leech off of poor people, the father works on a tech company, how is that parasitic?  you may be right to assume that rich people have an advantage in the exchange of value for labor, but i don&#39;t find this to be a parasitic relationship. The worker gets money, the factory gets labor. And while you may think that this is completely one sided it is mostly through this kind of exchanges that china has become a powerful country(for example). <br><br>Also this idea that it is impossible for poor people to become rich is just about the most ridiculous thing in this video.

But that to be honest, is a low bar.  The Park family is rich and seemingly superficially kind because they can afford to be. The Kim family is manipulative, and possibly criminal because their survival depends on it. In my opinion, that is where the nuance ends. <br>Is western capitalism, or neoliberalism the primary reason for the decline of humanity, if there is indeed a decline? Or it merely serves to spectacularly magnify the unpleasant aspects of innate human behavior? I don&#39;t pretend to know the answers. But Mr.  Joon-Ho sure does.

"While everyone seems content on focusing on symbolism and class warfare aspects of the movie, one important thing is not being paid attention to: the moral atrocity of the Kim family.

Imagine being given a job then taking that opportunity to constantly deceive your employer, taking the jobs of hardworking and honest people who have been in good service for years. <br><br>The second part of the movie is actually my saving grace: because it is the part where I feel like Kim family is about to get what they deserved for all their morally disturbing actions, especially when the old housekeeper found out about them and shot it on camera. It is even more disturbing to find out that the mother of Kim family is willing to kill someone for the purpose of hiding their real identities. I‚Äôm not convinced by what the mother said, referring to the mother of Parks family, that she‚Äôs not rich because she‚Äôs nice but ‚Äúnice because she‚Äôs rich‚Äù.

The idea that any foreign film are marginalized to the bottom with one award nomination. You begin to see how the Oscars are also a &quot;parasite&quot; that reap and lives off the labour of foreign films. They are fully aware on the impact the award show has on films, so they expect to receive numerous film applications which in return gives them a massive viewership on the award night.

The rich as she calls it does this.   Use the poor and others to do their bidding and usually have all the rules rigged to benefit them.   Accidents some times happen thought <b>ahem*. for those of you who are not completely blind to whats actually going on right now.      Corporatism is the new normal and the united states is to blame for this MOSTLY.     Others would say a banking family is what started all this but *ahem</b> most people consider that conspiracy theory.     Today you can easily Link most mega corporations and mega banks to very horrible deeds! yes, and these deeds are all about profit and power.    <br><br>Now what she has wrong.   Capitalism is Not what we are seeing today.  Capitalism is actually the best bad system humanity has ever made and has created many nations that do well still today and has lifted millions out of poverty.  Millions in a world of billions not good but better then the other choices we currently have.   It also however creates failing states and in a sense is what world trade is ruled by even now.  Some of these dictatorships you hear about only have One resource to captivate and sell on the global market meaning their citizens will never experience the same pleasures you and I experience.    To understand this better your need to understand the rules every leader needs to follow if they wish to KEEP or HOLD power.       Every state and nation has some capitalism in it other wise they would just fail.      What people keep getting wrong is Corporatism being confused as capitalism.           Yes the corporations are using the capitalist method, but they are also Posing as a state/nation.    A nation or state is a Government power ruled by the few.   Look at history books and you see all about loyalty,Honor and duty to the state  And betrayal, power grabs and revolts from the state.        What do we see today?   The very same thing in corporations.     The bigger the corporation is the more power they wield on states and Nations.    Its at the point where some mega corporations have regional power if they were a nation.     This is what we should fear this is the real monster the USA has unleashed on the world.         I am very unsure if it can be stopped with out major action and reaction from national powers. <br><br>This is why nationalism is making a comeback people are starting to wake up and realize the real danger of globalization.       When you lose the ability to make your own stuff you become a slave and depending on the people making it.   Who controls all our stuff?   Corporations and corporations need slave labor to keep profits and expand power.      This is the real scary monster.       But lets not kid our self&#39;s here.    Those of you specifically college age kids NEED to study the Horrors of Communism.     Regardless of the evils of corporatism and its for sure bad.   IT still not as bad as PURE GENOCIDE.     And china is the worse offender of this today having done so over 3 times now to their own people.     How many people have to die before people start realizing the evils of the world are In your own backyard in your class and in your society.     people need to STEP back and stop thinking with emotion and start realizing there is NO pretty picture and not real solutions with out Localization and building.     Dont expect others to solve your own problems.<br><br>Also id like to point out what some one else commented on.   &quot;Another lesson that can be drawn out of this is how easily the &quot;rags-to-riches&quot; individuals tend to forget their roots or where they started from. The Kims, once they are secured in their jobs and view themselves as moving up the wealth ladder, act the part of the rich.

This is something EVERYONE misses.  Socialism by definition, although good in intention, does a really poor job at rewarding those that produce value. In fact it does the opposite by removing rewards. <br><br>Government&#39;s role should be to make sure there is equal opportunities, not like it is now where they just print money and debase the currency at like 2% per year and cause inflation, yes, inflation is only caused one way, by printing. Just look at bitcoin, the value goes up because supply of coins are limited so you have to keep dividing the money.

I was asking my husband, so how do deaf people watch TV, that seems unfair in that sense as well. I will say I do understand dubbing movies for kids, for obvious reasons. The other horrible thing dubbing does is make French people think they own things they don&#39;t, like movies or tv series.

It is kind of intriguing. Death does equalize everyone, but one thing that can never be equalized is other people&#39;s memory of you. In Hinduism it is believed that whatever happens after your death is a direct result of your karma in your life. So basically, you could have died as a good person who gave joy and love to others while you were alive, or you could have died as a bad person, who gave pain and caused the suffering of others, or anything in between or apart from these two extremes.

There IS social mobility under capitalism, it&#39;s just not moral, hence apple getting rich off the backs of the poor. They got rich, so there is social mobility, but from immoral means.

As you can see from the oppression going on in the country right now but whatever. Also secondary the rich and poor groups are constantly moving and poor now is not like poor back then. Poor now even not including things that weren&#39;t around a hundred years ago okay let&#39;s say a cars for example fridge TV we discluded all of those and just made it about day-to-day life day today like specifically speaking is easier now than it was back then I know that sounds fake or like I&#39;m making it up but it&#39;s absolutely true now is it true in New York Chicago I will tell Iowa of the worst states to live.

There were certain areas that were better but trust me where I was in central Mexico that&#39;s real poor real poor and guess what lots of people who don&#39;t like white looking girls I&#39;m not white but I look like so unfortunately I don&#39;t have to tell that to people a lot. Anywhere, also it&#39;s funny that she says all this but it why is it that Republicans give more and practice and charity in real life when Democrats do why is that has anybody asked themselves. Poor and Rich alike it doesn&#39;t matter across-the-board Republicans give more I think there&#39;s a reason for that and maybe a reason you should look into learn a little something educate yourself for fun instead of listening to the mainstream media and idiots like this dumb b*<b>*</b> cuz you don&#39;t want what she is offering you by the way Korea I love Korea don&#39;t get me wrong I have absolutely door Korea South Korea obviously not North but the thing is they have a lot of class issues that stem from back when they weren&#39;t free and it has nothing to do with capitalism it has to do with the same b*<b>****</b> the English had for like 500 f*<b>***</b> years they still have it to some degree have you ever seen Parliament what happens there is four voting is concerned I mean who gets voted in who gets chosen it&#39;s almost all people who are distant relatives or relatives of somebody and so who&#39;s you know an English great family. I&#39;m not kidding all of them Barnett&#39;s ladies all of those people or Kings or Queens all of those people vote for those people I mean not the not the rich people I&#39;m talking about England as a whole typically votes for these elitist families and I&#39;m not saying elitist like they&#39;re snobs I mean it as they are the Elite families.

"The problem with the sentiment that people pull away from movies like this isn&#39;t that there isn&#39;t truth to be found in it regarding the flaws that can be found in capitalism, but that it tends to convince people to reject the system outright, and swing them into the opposite end of the spectrum, i.e. into the Marxist and communist camp which hold their own issues and severe capabilities for oppression. On the one hand, capitalism, most often thought of in the laissez faire sense, can grow to the extent to which an entity&#39;s influence is simply too large to be ignored, and that it becomes capable of gaming the system to itself, such as buying influence in government, or shutting down competitiveness in the market needed to sustain more positive aspects of the capitalism. People who claim to be enormous supporters of the free market on the surface, but will accept government bailouts at the expense of the taxpayer when an economic downturn emerges, are extremely hypocritical. No one should be allowed to steal wood from someone else&#39;s ship when theirs is sinking. Whatever reasons they may put forward to legitimate these actions, and whether one agrees or disagrees with the pros and cons of them in any given circumstance, many of the practices currently endorsed by so-called proponents of capitalism are inherently at odds with some of its foundational values, and seem to rarely be criticized by those invested in that system (however I should say this does not mean there aren&#39;t honest people who do.) <br>Speaking from a US perspective, in some ways, the current capitalism we have can be seen as a bastardization of it. In other ways, and sometimes by the same token, we can see the unethical tendencies that come part and parcel with it when allowed to exacerbate unchecked. While there are flaws, it cannot be said that capitalism hasn&#39;t contributed immensely to the progress of humanity as a whole, so in that, it&#39;s quite risky to throw the baby out with the bathwater in deciding whether it is simply good or not. The capitalist system is in a significant way directly tied to the notion of individual liberty. However, when powerful enough entities establish themselves by way of it, they can act increasingly unethical without taking on the rightly deserved accountability and consequences for it. Inferring from this, I believe the most responsible course of action ought to be to retain capitalism is some respect, but that the extent of it&#39;s corruptible nature should be curtailed by strictly enforced ethical principles. Compromise is very important, so while I agree with the right to free enterprise, it doesn&#39;t mean that I agree people/corporations should be allowed to use their stature for unabashed favoritism or objectively unethical behavior. If we don&#39;t begin articulating and implementing what these principles should be, corruption is simply inevitable. <br>Corruption is what a lot of these issues boil down to, and they are just as threatening under collectivist systems are they are capitalist ones.<br>In terms of the more collectivist ideologies, the promises made by these systems can be easily accepted on their surface and theory. The inherent perceived virtuousness of their common messages makes them all the more palpable to the public. However, though with different causes, the natural tendency of the direction these ideologies take produces many of the same issues as unchecked free market capitalism does, and not uncommonly worse. While I don&#39;t want to speak for everyone, and there are differing opinions on the extent to which these ideologies should influence the lives of citizens overall, for the sake of conciseness, I&#39;ll be more or less referring to communism, since many collectivist proponents tend to accept that it is the end stage of what they view as the natural progression of viable economic systems.",problem sentiment people pull away movies like truth found regarding flaws found capitalism tends convince people reject system outright swing opposite end spectrum marxist communist camp hold issues severe capabilities oppression one hand capitalism often thought laissez faire sense grow extent entity influence simply large ignored becomes capable gaming system buying influence government shutting competitiveness market needed sustain positive aspects capitalism people claim enormous supporters free market surface accept government bailouts expense taxpayer economic downturn emerges extremely hypocritical one allowed steal wood someone else ship sinking whatever reasons may put forward legitimate actions whether one agrees disagrees pros cons given circumstance many practices currently endorsed called proponents capitalism inherently odds foundational values seem rarely criticized invested system however say mean honest people speaking perspective ways current capitalism seen bastardization ways sometimes token see unethical tendencies come part parcel allowed exacerbate unchecked flaws said capitalism contributed immensely progress humanity whole quite risky throw baby bathwater deciding whether simply good capitalist system significant way directly tied notion individual liberty however powerful enough entities establish way act increasingly unethical without taking rightly deserved accountability consequences inferring believe responsible course action ought retain capitalism respect extent corruptible nature curtailed strictly enforced ethical principles compromise important agree right free enterprise mean agree people corporations allowed use stature unabashed favoritism objectively unethical behavior begin articulating implementing principles corruption simply inevitable corruption lot issues boil threatening collectivist systems capitalist ones terms collectivist ideologies promises made systems easily accepted surface theory inherent perceived virtuousness common messages makes palpable public however though different causes natural tendency direction ideologies take produces many issues unchecked free market capitalism uncommonly worse want speak everyone differing opinions extent ideologies influence lives citizens overall sake conciseness less referring communism since many collectivist proponents tend accept end stage view natural progression viable economic systems,positive

"When we think about corruption, we tend to think about outside forces worming their way into the government to disrupt what their priorities should be, usually through money, bribery, things we associate with capitalism.<br>When we think about tyranny, we think about government that has grown big enough and strong enough to overstep its boundaries and infringe on our civil and human rights, which is how many people view communism and other totalitarian regimes.<br>However, it&#39;s not immediately clear why our perception is so when we compare these two things. They are both situations we would call out as corruption, but what is the difference, and what are the implications of those differences? I think that the answer sounds something like this:<br>Corruption in government in a capitalist society fundamentally stems from the fact that we overtly allow the influence of money in government. We have lobbyists, we have politicians that get paid absurd sums of money from entities simply for giving a speech, and we have this tacit notion that money is speech. While this is last part is actually true, the current rules do not result in a fair representation of the public. Some can give more, some can give less. Rather than what we currently have, in addition to stricter bribery laws, we ought to enact legislation that says everyone is only allotted and allowed $1000 dollars to donate however they&#39;d like. Exceeding this would be unlawful and punishable. The issue with corruption of government in capitalist nations is a fixable issue if we can pass the right legislation to combat it. Government is a public service, not a business. The fact that you can come into it an average citizen and walk out a millionaire is a major symptom of that problem. If we get money out of politics, the people whom were involved for which would begin to weed out, and those who are legitimately interested in civil service would would begin finding their way in, as well as becoming freer to work for the public good without corporate interests obstructing their progress. In this scenario, we can get rid of the corruption, and power is retained in the hands of the people both by the democratic system and their financial support.<br>However, we now imagine a communist system, one in which an overarching governmental body innately controls all of the nations resources and decides how to distribute those resources to the people in a fair fashion. In this system, the individual does not have a the same bargaining chip for their voice or opinion. The government already controls the resources, and they&#39;re the ones who make the laws. In this system, without private property and ownership of what you independently produce, the government has the innate right to come to you to take what they say is theirs. Of course, in the pretext of doing so, the government will always insist that it is for &quot;the good of everyone and the country.&quot; But imagine if it wasn&#39;t. Imagine if this government controls the nation in it&#39;s totality, all the way down to the individual citizen and what they produce. If the government is corrupt, they take more for themselves or play favorites with the tribute they take from the hands of the worker, and there is absolutely no recourse for the citizen. The government already has all the land, production, makes all the laws, as well as controls the police and military. It can physically enforce it&#39;s &quot;right&quot; to take that tribute from you. Communism is always sold to the public as people collectively owning the land, but it is still big government by any other name. Worse than that, since communist regimes have reliably rejected the individual liberty to bear arms, they are utterly at the mercy of the totalitarian state. Now the state is not only the one with the nations resources, property, and laws in it&#39;s grip, it is the only one with guns. Notwithstanding scenarios of basic personal protection from other vagrant citizens, this situation alone should definitely concern people. If the government were ever to become irredeemably corrupt, the people are simply incapable of ever physically taking that power back. This isn&#39;t to say it couldn&#39;t happen through a long arduous process of infiltration and persuasion of the powers, but history has shown us that the corrupt faction uses every tool at its disposal to prevent that from happening (propaganda, internet censorship, politcal prison, intimidation, coercion, erasure of right to protest, erasure of free speech to criticize, erasure of basic human liberties.) As we see in communist china, the people are living under the ever-present thumb of the government. They have some of the most oppressive, coercive, and fear-inciting intimidation tactics in the modern world. It is a place of thought police and speech police. A place where mere accusation is enough to have you pursued and silenced. A place where they can put you in a chastity cage on live TV to shame you, and make you apologize for criticizing the government in a facebook post. It is a place where if they cannot get to you, they will go after your family. A place where totalitarian control by the state forces you to filter your thoughts, words, and actions to conform to them. A place where your destiny is not your own. <br>In an ideal world, we would be able to trust the government in managing the totality of power and resource control that we turn over to them, but realistically, the powerful people in government are human like anyone else. They play favorites, want to protect their own interests and power, and will oppress the masses in order to retain these things and the system that supports it. When people vote for communism, they have never received what they thought they were going to get. Many people will criticize capitalistic society as a plutocracy, or worry about the emergence of one. The benefit to a capitalist free nation like the United States is that we can enact laws to prevent this from happening. It is indeed feasible to create a system where people can enjoy the right to free enterprise without allowing that enterprise to get out of control, provided we elect the right leaders and pass the right laws. However, by voting for a communist regime to take power, you are inherently voting for a plutocracy. Collectivist systems like communism are idealistic, and assume that no matter how many attempts at this have resulted in extreme suffering, oppression, or abject failure, one day someone will do it right. This is not a an optimistic endeavor to pursue. Whether it&#39;s the history of 100 million deaths, or the fact that people are still risking their lives to escape it today, we must take the idea of implementing it into any part of the world with great caution. <br>For all of it&#39;s history and flaws, capitalism has comparably fared much better overall in improving the lives of citizens under it. It is a system that mimics the natural world. A system that acknowledges that while not all things can be equal in every sphere, equality cannot simply be artificially imposed on the world. Capitalism has been and still is the most reliable and efficient mode of innovation, of raising the overall standard of living for all people, and remains the economic system that provides the greatest amount of liberty to every individual citizen. It cannot be stressed enough, that the radical collectivist systems of the world seem to be fundamentally at odds with the notions of individual, inalienable rights and liberty we take for granted in the US. It&#39;s important to remember that communism is not just an economic system, but a political one primarily, and politics is the game bureaucrats play to test to what extent they can dictate your life.<br>It can be confusing to parse, sometimes, but when we look back at the US, it is a crucial difference that the people control the economy, not the government. While government can make rules and regulations about business practices, they cannot take that business away from you. The notion of free enterprise is inherently power in the hands of the people. It is not something we should be willing to give up, because if we change our minds, who knows how many years, decades, or lives it might cost to get it back. Communism always starts as some form of grassroots &quot;people&#39;s movement,&quot; but overtime inevitably grows to the oppressive hierarchical power structure they didn&#39;t want. Remember this, and also remember to be inherently distrustful of all big government. At the end of the day, big government is always interested in trying to control something, so be wary of what it is they&#39;re seeking to control. Lastly, be very careful what your asking for of it, because you might not always like what you get in the end.",think corruption tend think outside forces worming way government disrupt priorities

They pay them &quot;fair&quot; value based on equilibrium market prices. Anyone with two arms and half a brain can build an iPhone (Which is becoming more and more automated every year anyway). When there&#39;s hundreds of millions of people worldwide with no other marketable skills than those pertaining to doing menial labor then of course their compensation is going to be very little. It&#39;s just the way the market works. The Park family did absolutely nothing wrong throughout the movie. They did&#39;t leach off anyone. Mr. Park built a highly successful technology company. Hence why he can afford the nice house. He had a valuable idea and made a valuable contribution to society. Mr. Kim has been through dozens of failed ventures. He just doesn&#39;t have what it takes.

"Parasite was a hard film to stomach. Often times I definitely think that middle class and lower class communities are allied in a sense against the rich and the oppressive capitalist systems. But Parasite tells the truth that a lot of us middle class and lower class folks don&#39;t want to admit. That we often times admire or even worship the wealthy, in hopes that we can get a taste of the life they get to live. We would rather fight each other for scraps and attempt to &quot;eliminate our competition&quot; than unite and try to find a way to dismantle the system and people that put us against one another in the first place. <br><br>The Kim family didn&#39;t stop to think about the jobs they were stealing and the lives they were ruining by taking them. The original housekeeper had safety in the Park home, away from loan sharks and access to her husband to keep him fed and to check on him. Then she was kicked out from her safe haven, couldn&#39;t even tell her husband what happened probably. Mrs. Kim looks down on the housekeeper, accepting the role she has as an upper class housekeeper over the jobless, beaten and desperate lower class former housekeeper. She cannot empathize with her anymore. Even though promising to feed her husband would be such an easy and harmless thing to do, she refuses. The conflict could have been mostly avoided had she not forgotten where she comes from and empathized with the woman and agreed to help her out in such a small way. <br><br>Everybody in Parasite is a parasite and a host simultaneously. The poor are hosts to the rich parasites, being used for their mostly cheap labor, doing unfulfilling and draining tasks for low wages, just trying to survive themselves. The poor are parasites to the rich hosts by manipulating them and using them to hopefully advance their social and economic class further up. They didn&#39;t care what happened to the people they got fired. They didn&#39;t care about the Park family as people, except for maybe Da-Hye who while blissfully was able to enjoy her privilege of wealth, didn&#39;t actively think badly of the poor and even despite Kevin and  his family smelling like &quot;poor&quot; she still found him attractive.<br><br> She became a victim by having her seemingly normal boyfriend being bludgeoned and having to carry him to safety, learning later on that the driver killed her father, the driver who is her boyfriend&#39;s father, how her boyfriend&#39;s entire family was using her family and that her boyfriend was never really who he said he was, she fell in love with a person that he was not, a person who is later just outed as a scammer along with his mother, permanently living with brain damage. The reason parasite was so good, I believe, is because it wasn&#39;t the straight forward &quot;rich people bad&quot; commentary a lot of us expected. It was commentary on capitalist society as a whole, and how even the good intentioned or those who are taking an opportunity for a better life are not all innocent. How we all have blood on our hands. <br><br>Watching the Kim family and the housekeeper and her husband fight like animals was one of the harder scenes to watch. How one poor family threatened the other poor family with exposing them for who they truly are in hopes to tear them down the same way they tore them down or maybe even in hopes of getting her job back. How one poor family murdered &quot;one of them&quot; just to keep up with their facade for not even much longer. Only when the Kim family loses everything they had going for them, do they gain some sort of empathy and human-ness back. There seems to be lots of regret, lots of remorse. Losing a daughter, losing a sister but not being able to truly grieve because you have brain damage, losing the chance of normalcy you got only a taste of because you became the very thing you hated or envied, greedy parasites.",parasite hard film stomach often times definitely think middle class lower class communities allied sense rich oppressive capitalist systems parasite tells truth lot middle class lower class folks want admit often times admire even worship wealthy hopes get taste life get live would rather fight scraps attempt quot eliminate competition quot unite try find way dismantle system people put one another first place kim family stop think jobs stealing lives ruining taking original housekeeper safety park home away loan sharks access husband keep fed check kicked safe even tell husband happened probably mrs kim looks housekeeper accepting role upper class housekeeper jobless beaten desperate lower class former housekeeper empathize anymore even though promising feed husband would easy harmless thing refuses conflict could mostly avoided forgotten comes empathized woman agreed help small way everybody parasite parasite host simultaneously poor hosts rich parasites used mostly cheap labor unfulfilling draining tasks low wages trying survive poor parasites rich hosts manipulating using hopefully advance social economic class care happened people got fired care park family people except maybe hye blissfully able enjoy privilege wealth actively think badly poor even despite kevin family smelling like quot poor quot still found attractive became victim seemingly normal boyfriend bludgeoned carry safety learning later driver killed father driver boyfriend father boyfriend entire family using family boyfriend never really said fell love person person later outed scammer along mother permanently living brain damage reason parasite good believe straight forward quot rich people bad quot commentary lot expected commentary capitalist society whole even good intentioned taking opportunity better life innocent blood hands watching kim family housekeeper husband fight like animals one harder scenes watch one poor family threatened poor family exposing truly hopes tear way tore maybe even hopes getting job back one poor family murdered quot one quot keep facade even much longer kim family loses everything going gain sort empathy human ness back seems lots regret lots remorse losing daughter losing sister able truly grieve brain damage losing chance normalcy got taste became thing hated envied greedy parasites,positive

"Interesting movie.  Nice analysis.  While capitalism does lead to exploitation of an underclass, it does, in fact, allow anyone from the underclass to move into the upper echelon of society.  By the same token, people in the upper echelon can easily move into the underclass.   It happens all the time.  Possibly not in one generation, but often it does.  The same cannot be said of communism.   There,  only people within the government are in the upper class, and everyone else is exploited.  Socialism is somewhere in between, but is likely to have more barriers, not less, to movement from lower to higher...and vice-versa.  The &quot;safety net&quot; protects people from becoming &quot;too poor&quot; (in theory), but also takes so much of their income to pay for it that it makes it harder to advance.",interesting movie nice analysis capitalism lead exploitation underclass fact allow anyone underclass move upper echelon society token people upper echelon easily move underclass happens time possibly one generation often said communism people within government upper class everyone else exploited socialism somewhere likely barriers less movement lower higher vice versa quot safety net quot protects people becoming quot poor quot theory also takes much income pay makes harder advance,positive

"A note to the 564 years to buy that house fact: You won&#39;t ever achieve higher by saving, which is why the note on saving hundreds of years worth of money based on an average or minimum is stupid, and the reason for that is the following; saving as a strategy to retain and increase wealth tied to an income source (like a job) that stays the same or increases too little, is depending on a lineal growth which is tending to 0, because the expenses are the same and the income is the same, which means the savings are never enough to make a difference, plus, the strategy is vulnerable to a psyche of &quot;Now I have more and can allow myself more&quot; which means that when there&#39;s a slight increase in the income, there&#39;s a slight increase in the spending, over the years, when the increase starts getting big compared to starting point, the increase in the spending has become big too, the best example is when a new hire earns the minimum allowed for its job post and education, over the years this person attains a higher pay through a higher job and antiquity/experience, eg: mid-managerial position, but by then this person has stopped spending on the basic needs, own housing, transport and plans with friends, or helping the parents if living with them, instead they pay a mid-tier car, nicer clothing, nicer living, maybe kids, etc... In the worst case they&#39;re thrown in a curve of decrease and they can&#39;t even afford their livestyle, the most fatal flaw of that strategy, and helps to further deepen that situation by the other dinamic involved in this: positive interest and debt. These two can be deemed as the outside factor of the strategy that doesn&#39;t fit in, because they can be exponential, due to the interest rates. Positive interest will refer here to the payments the bank does for lending them your money by keeping it there (what most do, if you&#39;re lending money outside of that context it&#39;s another story) while debt is when  you do the opposite through any entity (bank, institution, person, etc...) the trick is, generally when people get carried out (and most get carried out) they&#39;re inflating their debt more than what they&#39;re collecting from the debtors, the reason being that the payout of the bank is lesser than what they&#39;re expecting from you. Further, the dependance of people on systems of income that depend on their human availabilities and usually 1 only source (this is refering to 1 job or 2 jobs) doesn&#39;t allow them to grow in this regard, and things like having kids when not able to care for them in excellence (hence, making these children bad investments and a way to destroy the savings via increasing the costs while having no new income sources) just make it worse. This is what most people don&#39;t understand and that&#39;s part of why these crazy numbers come up, it is obvious you can&#39;t go as fast as an sports car if you keep doing what the slower cyclist is doing.",note years buy house fact ever achieve higher saving note saving hundreds years worth money based average minimum stupid reason following saving strategy retain increase wealth tied income source like job stays increases little depending lineal growth tending expenses income means savings never enough make difference plus strategy vulnerable psyche quot allow quot means slight increase income slight increase spending years increase starts getting big compared starting point increase spending become big best example new hire earns minimum allowed job post education years person attains higher pay higher job antiquity experience mid managerial position person stopped spending basic needs housing transport plans friends helping parents living instead pay mid tier car nicer clothing nicer living maybe kids etc worst case thrown curve decrease even afford livestyle fatal flaw strategy helps deepen situation dinamic involved positive interest debt two deemed outside factor strategy fit exponential due interest rates positive interest refer payments bank lending money keeping lending money outside context another story debt opposite entity bank institution person etc trick generally people get carried get carried inflating debt collecting debtors reason payout bank lesser expecting dependance people systems income depend human availabilities usually source refering job jobs allow grow regard things like kids able care excellence hence making children bad investments way destroy savings via increasing costs new income sources make worse people understand part crazy numbers come obvious fast sports car keep slower cyclist,positive

The solution is Christ&#39;s forgiveness of our sinful nature and his sacrifice which has caused God the Father to look at us and smile, seeing Christ&#39;s goodness instead of our own (which is none at all).

"First I&#39;m very grateful for you for having posted such value content. Most of us wouldn&#39;t have been able to interpret the movie and the director&#39;s vision as accurately the way you did here (me included). This one was a real eye opener. Will probably watch it again.<br>Now that we live in such terrifying conditions (neoliberal capitalism...). There are questions that come to mind such as:<br>Isn&#39;t all of this just the workings of human nature?<br>What can be the solution?<br>Before thinking about answering this questions I would like to use quotes from books to establish some undeniabe facts first.<br>About the so called game of rich being winners and poor being loosers. The game of power perhaps?<br>As the great renaissance diplomat and courtier Niccol√≤ Machiavelli wrote, &quot;Any man who tries to be good all the time is bound to come to ruin among the great number who are not good.&quot; The court imagined itself the pinnacle of refinement, but underneath its glittering surface a cauldron of dark emotions-greed, envy, lust, hatred- boiled and simmered. <br>(A Cauldron is a large cast iron pot for cooking or boiling over an open fire, with a large pot and frequently with an arc-shaped hanger. Courtesy of Wikipedia).<br>Meanwhile the court was supposed to represent the height of civilization and refinement.<br>Our world today similarly imagines itself the pinnacle of fairness, yet the same ugly emotions still stir within us, as they have forever. The game is the same.<br>Now these above mentioned ugly emotions... They are just as real as a lighthouse is to a ship, they are principles, they are traits of our human nature. They are as real as a ship smashing into the rocks at night because of ignoring the warning, the lighthouse is signaling. [chuckles...]<br>So in this scenario the cause of all evil in this world roots therefore from human nature. And in light of this we can ask ourselves:<br>What can we do about it?<br>There is one answer that could be:<br>If the world is like a giant scheming court and we are trapped inside it, there is no use in trying to opt out of the game. That will only render you powerless and powerlessness will make you miserable. Instead of struggling against the inevitable (human nature), instead of arguing and whining and feeling guilty, it is far better to excel at power. If the game of power is inescapable, better to be an artist than a denier or a bungler. To transform yourself into a superior actor on the stage of life and enjoy your moment in the limelight.<br><br>The above mentionned answer could certainly be the way to the self-destruction of humanity. Today the ultimate power being the pocession nuclear weapons.<br><br>The other and second answer is the following: (Here I quote the great Osho)<br>[The world is certainly preparing for a global suicide, about that there are not two options - it is becoming every day more and more certain. Naturally you think you have to do somthing to prevent it. (just like my 3 questions in the begining)<br>It is beyond your doing, beyond your control; whatever you do will bring it closer.<br>What can you do? The power is not your hands; the power is in hands which are absolutely stubborn, and they don&#39;t care a bit what happens to humanity. Their ego is their supreme value, the only value. Even though it means their own destruction, they will take the risk; they will destroy whoever the think is their enemy.<br>In the beginning, when this kind of war material was in the hands of two countries, the Soviet Union and America, there was some possibility that they may come to some negociation. Now with the power of nuclear weapons in five countries, the possibility of negociation has become more difficult, more complicated. And by the time when the power will be in twenty-five countrie&#39;s hands. Then the question of negociation does not arise. My suggestion is: time is certainly very short, but it is enough to become enlightned, and it is enough to spread an enlighned atmosphere around the world. That is the only possibility.<br>If we can make the people of the world...not the politicians, leave them aside; they have the power but without the consent of the people  of the world, their power is not of much use. If armies simply say, &quot;No, we are not going to use nuclear weapons,&quot; if scientists simply say, &quot;No, we are  not going to produce any more nuclear weapons,&quot; if the whole intelligentsia of the world unanimously creates a great uproar: &quot;It is not a question of war; wars we have seen in thousands - they have been destructive, but they have not destroyed all life. This is not war, this is simple suicide!&quot;.<br>But these people: the scientists, the armies, the intelligentsia, the poets, the musicians, the mystics, the painters, the actors - the people who have a certain impact on the masses, although they don&#39;t have any power except their individuality and their creativity - if they join hands together, this global suicide can be avoided. Not only suicide can be avoided, but with the same energy that was going to destroy all life, the planet can be turned into a paradise. ]<br><br>Now obviously this went beyond the scope of capitalism and rich and poor but it is all connected<br>But yeah here are two great answers.

"You make some great points, however, I don&#39;t think we can ignore either direction of parasitism. I think ultimately, both families being parasitic on each other points to capitalistic idealism being parasitic on genuine human relationship and society. Vilifying the rich doesn&#39;t really solve the problem. Both the rich and poor are involved in a larger vicious system which idealizes the situation of the Parks. But as we see, the Park&#39;s lifestyle isn&#39;t ideal because even their interfamilial relationships are diminished by this idealization of wealth, and even they suffer the effects of the divisions of class. They try to block out the pain of life, not only as represented by the poor, but also as represented by their own flaws, weaknesses, and suffering. Even they are slaves to the idealization of wealth and wealthy living, and are unable to really be satisfied by it. We see this in the juxtaposition of the Kim family&#39;s assumptions that wealth makes it easier to love, and easier to be nice, and the stark reality that both families really love each other while still struggling to love authentically, and both families uphold a false air of niceness, while still sometimes being truly nice, at least to each other. Neither family is simply virtuous or vicious, but both struggle to be truly nice and loving, especially in the face of the pursuit of wealth.<br>Thus, it does not good to simply treat the rich as the source of the problem. They too are enslaved to the idealization of wealthy living, as even their own attainment of it cannot satisfy, and they are always looking for new sources and displays of affluence to distract from the pain of life. The Kims, insofar as they have affluence to flaunt, do so readily (think of their treatment of the drunk outside their home). Neither family is simply at fault, and both families display a vicious parasitism, even though the lower class Kim family&#39;s parasitism is more visible and more immediately shocking. They are problematic and vicious in different ways, but ultimately they are tied to the same source: Capitalistic idealism. Both families treat wealth as the solution to all problems. Both families are ultimately &quot;destroyed&quot; by this, by the separation, wounding, and death of their members. Though the Parks &quot;escape&quot; the violence and the Kims must face it every day since they are still in their home, it is interesting that it is the Parks home where this all takes place. Both have their lives upended by this cruel reality of capitalist idealism. Both presumably continue in this idealism even in the face of that violence. This is the true horror.",make great points however think ignore either direction parasitism think ultimately families parasitic points capitalistic idealism parasitic genuine human relationship society vilifying rich really solve problem rich poor involved larger vicious system idealizes situation parks see park lifestyle ideal even interfamilial relationships diminished idealization wealth even suffer effects divisions class try block pain life represented poor also represented flaws weaknesses suffering even slaves idealization wealth wealthy living unable really satisfied see juxtaposition kim family assumptions wealth makes easier love easier nice stark reality families really love still struggling love authentically families uphold false air niceness still sometimes truly nice least neither family simply virtuous vicious struggle truly nice loving especially face pursuit wealth thus good simply treat rich source problem enslaved idealization wealthy living even attainment satisfy always looking new sources displays affluence distract pain life kims insofar affluence flaunt readily think treatment drunk outside home neither family simply fault families display vicious parasitism even though lower class kim family parasitism visible immediately shocking problematic vicious different ways ultimately tied source capitalistic idealism families treat wealth solution problems families ultimately quot destroyed quot separation wounding death members though parks quot escape quot violence kims must face every day since still home interesting parks home takes place lives upended cruel reality capitalist idealism presumably continue idealism even face violence true horror,positive
"This is a really good explanation of the social classes between the rich and poor. but I feel like you&#39;re failing to see the other side of the coin.<br><br>This film had a very fresh and unpopular theme and I think that&#39;s what set it to be the best picture of the year. Instead of the typical stories where the upper class is about oppressing the lower, it views it in a neutral light about it all. Where most films about social class see things as black and white, Parasite presented it in a shade of grey. That it&#39;s about the parasites in society in general. It goes as far as to sometimes paint the poor as the bad guys, especially when they meet people who were worse off, or &quot;poorer,&quot; than them. I know it sounds terrible to say, but I think that&#39;s what is so bold about this film and what set it apart from your average stories about class. I think it&#39;s the reason why Knives Out wasn&#39;t put on the same level as Parasite, despite it also being about social class. It paints it so obviously who is good and who is bad.<br><br>Bong has said some of this himself, in an interview before the Oscars and please forgive me as I couldn&#39;t find the source, he said something along the lines of, &quot;Growing up, sometimes I thought we were poor but then I would see people who were much worse off than myself and realized we were very fortunate actually, suddenly I felt like we weren&#39;t very poor at all.&quot; I wish I could find the quote but I think it was a spoken interview.<br><br>I might be wrong on this but one of the things that stuck out to me in the film was that there were the many times throughout the movie where the father and mother behave a bit dark showing lack of certain virtues. &quot;I&#39;d be nice too if I were rich&quot; was said by the mother but then is shown she is willing to kill someone to protect their wealth. The father had times where he&#39;s tested on his morality, you can&#39;t shake away the moment when they were getting drunk and he nearly hits his wife and plays it off as a joke. When he is driving the car for the rich dad, he shows a lack of self discipline when he continues to turn around and not pay attention on the road. When the rich father, during the son&#39;s birthday, wanted to pretend to be Indians for his son to enjoy himself, the poor father asks him, &quot;Why do you do all this?&quot; The rich father replies, &quot;Because I love my son,&quot; to which the poor father stops and seems to reflect on that saying &quot;Because you love your son...&quot;<br><br>One of the most important things about the film that would&#39;ve been cool to see in this video is the way the poor perceived what being rich meant, overindulgence. It&#39;s a common theme in films about wealth that some view that being rich means living excessively. To put it more simply, you can still be poor even if you have all the money in the world.<br><br>Also I want to bring up a quote from &quot;All the Money in the World&quot; that I think relates to the overall picture of what being poor can mean. Near the beginning of the film, the father somberly tells Amy Adams, &quot;I&#39;m sorry that we are poor,&quot; and she replies, &quot;We&#39;re not poor, we&#39;re just broke.&quot;",really good explanation social classes rich poor feel like failing see side coin film fresh unpopular theme think set best picture year instead typical stories upper class oppressing lower views neutral light films social class see things black white parasite presented shade grey parasites society general goes far sometimes paint poor bad guys especially meet people worse quot poorer quot know sounds terrible say think bold film set apart average stories class think reason knives put level parasite despite also social class paints obviously good bad bong said interview oscars please forgive find source said something along lines quot growing sometimes thought poor would see people much worse realized fortunate actually suddenly felt like poor quot wish could find quote think spoken interview might wrong one things stuck film many times throughout movie father mother behave bit dark showing lack certain virtues quot nice rich quot said mother shown willing kill someone protect wealth father times tested morality shake away moment getting drunk nearly hits wife plays joke driving car rich dad shows lack self discipline continues turn around pay attention road rich father son birthday wanted pretend indians son enjoy poor father asks quot quot rich father replies quot love son quot poor father stops seems reflect saying quot love son quot one important things film would cool see video way poor perceived rich meant overindulgence common theme films wealth view rich means living excessively put simply still poor even money world also want bring quote quot money world quot think relates overall picture poor mean near beginning film father somberly tells amy adams quot sorry poor quot replies quot poor broke quot,positive

"Dillon Because most of the rich don‚Äôt ‚Äúwork like dogs‚Äù to be where they‚Äôre at. People like corporate CEOs profit from the labors performed by lower-working classes that make their money for them, who still find themselves stuck in poverty no matter how hard they work. Jeff Bezos isn‚Äôt getting up every day to send out Amazon packages and move boxes around in the warehouses, is he? The end of the movie even touches on this, where Ki-Woo is shown to have made enough money to buy the house like he wrote to his dad. It then pans back to him sitting with a hopeless expression in his home, and the bleak reality that he will never be able to make that much money in his life. No matter how hard someone works, it is nearly impossible for most to achieve such a high economic status, and the notion that anyone can get rich through pure, hard work is a fantasy that tons of people still buy into to this day. If this were even true, there would be a lot less working poor in the world, don‚Äôt you think? The whole issue with sucking it up and taking the ‚Äúcards you are dealt with‚Äù is that the ‚Äúcard-dealing‚Äù is built upon an exploitative system that favors the rich, making them richer whilst keeping the poor poor at the same time. We live in a broken system, and there‚Äôs no reason that the disparity between the rich and poor needs to exist. It does not have to be this way, and it shouldn‚Äôt. No one person should have billions of dollars, especially dollars that they‚Äôre collecting off the work of the poorer classes they take advantage of. There are so many people who work their asses off and won‚Äôt see even a fraction of that amount of money within their lifetime.

Does this mean if I don&#39;t have white skin, I am not a &#39;goddess&#39;, therefore I am just an ordinary mortal and therefore &quot;less than&quot;? And don&#39;t even get me started on the (strange?) coincidence that the actress in that commercial is Heart Evangelista, who is beyond rich and privileged! Getting back to my point earlier, a discussion on skin color ultimately leads to classism - Refinery29 did this documentary about skin whitening in Asia and the women (a lot of them Filipina) that they interviewed explicitly confirmed that having white skin leads to greater, better opportunities as opposed to having darker skinned.",hello broey deschanel first love name second read pinned comment need apologize putting commercial skin whitening product fact spot filipino agree obsession white skin ultimately tied classism fact commercial explicitly says quot para puting pang dyosa quot loosely translates quot white skin like goddess quot mean mean white skin goddess therefore ordinary mortal therefore quot less quot even get started strange coincidence actress commercial heart evangelista beyond rich privileged getting back point earlier discussion skin color ultimately leads classism refinery documentary skin whitening asia women lot filipina interviewed explicitly confirmed white skin leads greater better opportunities opposed darker skinned,positive

"Overall, I think the moral of the story is that there will alwayss be someone &quot;beneath&quot; you. And there&#39;s no telling exactly how or why. Capitalism is real, poverty is real, but ultimately, death is assured to everyone. And within life, people are always trying to chase the next thing or maintain what they already have- what may seem like greed to some may be practical, even righteous to others. But most people get a taste of each &quot;side&quot; within their lifetime. That&#39;s where privilege gets tricky. Like when rich mom (i watched the movie a while ago so i forgot names) talked about how she used to ride the subway. And the daughter getting to have that bath. I used to live in LA and it is the greatest example of this, probably in the world. You have some of the richest, most successful people in the country living amongst an increasing homeless population. Some of the homeless used to live perfectly normal lives- perhaps even middle or upper class. Yet drugs left them with close to nothing. And yet, the drug crisis is a prominent issue among the upper class as well. I know I went all over the place, but this topic is such a trip. And this film captured the dramatic, horrific, and sometimes comical nature of it all.",overall think moral story alwayss someone quot beneath quot telling exactly capitalism real poverty real ultimately death assured everyone within life people always trying chase next thing maintain already may seem like greed may practical even righteous others people get taste quot side quot within lifetime privilege gets tricky like rich mom watched movie ago forgot names talked used ride subway daughter getting bath used live greatest example probably world richest successful people country living amongst increasing homeless population homeless used live perfectly normal lives perhaps even middle upper class yet drugs left close nothing yet drug crisis prominent issue among upper class well know went place topic trip film captured dramatic horrific sometimes comical nature,positive

And actually, most European countries see being tanned as the beauty standard. For the same reasons. Having a darker complexion is seen as desirable in many European countries because it was linked to being wealthy in the 1900s and having the time to relax in the sun and go on holiday, while poorer people didn&#39;t have that luxury so didn&#39;t really tan (as European jobs in the 1900s weren&#39;t so much outside jobs as they were in offices and factories).

They do not have to be ‚Äùevil‚Äù because they don&#39;t have to waste their time thinking about paying their bills at the end of every month. And, yeah, People do want to be rich because capitalism gives them false hope that they can. Serfs did not try to get rich under feudalism because they knew it didn&#39;t matter how much they work; it is pretty much impossible for them to get out of the class they were born in. The problem is, how can we tolerate the system that allowed the wealthiest 1% own half the world&#39;s wealth, when children in Africa are dying of hunger. We have to ask ourselves. Can we do better than this?",lol nobody saying rich people bad rich people get rich backs poor people country like bangladesh country children young six working factories treated slaves making clothes wear west bad people nature system accumulate exploit workers much profit rich people living privilege position evil waste time thinking paying bills end every month yeah people want rich capitalism gives false hope serfs try get rich feudalism knew matter much work pretty much impossible get class born problem tolerate system allowed wealthiest half world wealth children africa dying hunger ask better,positive

"I am growing so tired of these anti-capitalism think pieces. They never tell the truth of the matter. They always make blameless the lower class by placing the blame on the upper class. Here are some truths. <br><br><br>1. Capitalism provides opportunity for upward mobility. It does not limit your ability to become the next Steve Jobs or the Next Zuckerberg<br>2. There are two factors that divide classes in a capitalistic society: Intelligence and Motivation. You need them both to rise to the 1%. You can be a genius and spend all your days surfing. You won&#39;t make it then. You can be stupid and infinitely motivated. You won&#39;t make it then either. To be a Bezos, you need both. <br>3. Socialism seeks to limit those with intelligence and motivation for the sake of those that lack one or both. <br>4. Being born without the ability to become a doctor is not the fault of society. And it is not moral to have a governmental system that grants equal outcome rather than equal access. <br>5. The role of government is to enforce equal access to success. Any other type of system necessarily limits a class of people. That is immoral.  <br><br><br>When I was a kid and made a stupid choice, my grandmother would quip &quot;Well, the world will always need ditch diggers.&quot; And she was right. Those that did not win the genetic lottery (and being totally honest here, that is 99% of us) will always be limited by their intrinsic governor. You can not take everyone, send them to med school, and think everyone will overcome their limits with the right education. We can not all be doctors. <br><br><br>Socialism is taking any average Joe off the street and throwing them into the NFL. Then when they under-perform, rather than cutting them from the team,  we start limiting the performance of those around him so that the average Joe&#39;s stats look competitive. That is ridiculous in thought and practice. <br><br><br>Life is a meritocracy. Evolution is a meritocracy. The most successful modern societies all started off as meritocracies. The US is a meritocracy. Making it anything else is counter to human and societal evolution. For the sake of the human race, the weak must be allowed to fail and the strong must be allowed to succeed. Intelligent parents tend to produce intelligent offspring. Stupid parents tend to produce stupid offspring. While stupid parents can beat the odds and produce an intelligent child, this is not the rule. And intelligent parents can produce stupid children. Again, not typical. But who are we to decide the outcome for either?",growing tired anti capitalism think pieces never tell truth matter always make blameless lower class placing blame upper class truths capitalism provides opportunity upward mobility limit ability become next steve jobs next zuckerberg two factors divide classes capitalistic society intelligence motivation need rise genius spend days surfing make stupid infinitely motivated make either bezos need socialism seeks limit intelligence motivation sake lack one born without ability become doctor fault society moral governmental system grants equal outcome rather equal access role government enforce equal access success type system necessarily limits class people immoral kid made stupid choice grandmother would quip quot well world always need ditch diggers quot right win genetic lottery totally honest always limited intrinsic governor take everyone send med school think everyone overcome limits right education doctors socialism taking average joe street throwing nfl perform rather cutting team start limiting performance around average joe stats look competitive ridiculous thought practice life meritocracy evolution meritocracy successful modern societies started meritocracies meritocracy making anything else counter human societal evolution sake human race weak must allowed fail strong must allowed succeed intelligent parents tend produce intelligent offspring stupid parents tend produce stupid offspring stupid parents beat odds produce intelligent child rule intelligent parents produce stupid children typical decide outcome either,positive
"@shwwnn Self sacrifice for the benefit of your offspring is one of the most noble of endeavors. Most people are doing exactly that.

Though, it can appear that way in a meritocracy.<br><br><br>The fact is that biological differences determine how many rungs are on your ladder.",shwwnn premise wrong assume everyone wants move top ladder simply true rung ladder means individual liberty compromised infinite number rungs freedom move individual sees fit best design individual determine work life balance trust fund kids aside successful successful held people though appear way meritocracy fact biological differences determine many rungs ladder,positive
"@ballzack57 The lack of humanity is not in the price of labor, it is in the hearts of humans. Capitalism is an ideology just like communism or socialism is. It is the ideology of the pursuit of wealth above, at the expense of, all else, including happiness, and humanity. People sacrifice their own health, well being, and time with their children just so they can move up the ladder even if they are already doing well where they are. Is that not the mark of an ideologue?<br><br><br>When the master sees his stableman eating hay and not feel anything, but just thinks about the money, he is no longer human. When Apple heads know the condition of the factory workers and not feel anything, but just think about money, they too are no longer human. If the master of the stableman only agrees to pay more because all workers have banded together and forced him to, he&#39;s still no better than before. Only when he decides to live for something other than just money, but also for himself, for his heart, to allow it to feel things it has the ability to feel, and to do things more meaningful and beautiful than just the pursuit of wealth at the expense of all, including his own soul, does he become human.<br><br><br>Otherwise he&#39;s just a more skilled parasite.<br><br><br>Workers do not generally band together because there&#39;s not enough love among them.

"@shwwnn The presupposition of your opening statement is faulty. We &quot;deserve&quot; nothing. <br><br>The humanity, or lack there of, in the price of labor is consequential. My argument is not counter to that idea. My argument is that it is not the role of government to set that value. To do so would require a devaluation of the top for the benefit of the bottom.  This can seem benevolent but, it is immoral. <br><br><br>Unions were formed by the wage-earners in order that they set their own valuation of their labor. This is the best way forward. At least in my opinion. <br><br><br>Globalism makes unionizing more difficult and possibly impossible. Why pay $20 per hour here in the States when that same labor can be purchased for $2.00 overseas? <br><br><br>The answer to this quandary is yet unknown. But, if all the ditch diggers refused to dig for anything less than a livable wage, then they would either need to find a new job, or they would get a livable wage. <br><br>This is the point of the movie. Not that capitalism is bad, but that the ditch diggers do not cooperate for the greater good of them as a class. <br><br><br>I lost a business in the early 2000&#39;s because cheap immigrant labor came in and said they would do the job for less than I could comfortably live on. I was not willing to become working class poor. If none of the native labor would have accepted the new lower wage, then none of us would need to look for other work. <br><br><br>Getting people to work for the greater good is difficult.

"Just subscribed! Not only were you informative but you asked a good question of &quot;Who are the parasites?&quot; <br><br>The kind of NeoLiberal Capitalism that has arisen in society is a lot more pervasive than we are willing to admit. Even I have this mentality of &quot;I have worked for this, why should anyone else benefit from it&quot; that convinces me to believe in less taxation, deregulation and free trade. Imagine going from even low class and working your way to middle class only to realize that the government will tax you more now because of your income bracket. The thought of actually working more, working harder, only to then earn a smaller percentage of what you expected to make is quite disheartening and my knee-jerk response is to say &quot;government, please stay away from it.&quot; <br><br>But then I realize it&#39;s definitely the mentality of the rich as well. I am talking about those who earn disparate amounts of annual income who have convinced themselves they work hard enough and have managed the company enough that they deserve not to be taxed as much. And so, they either send their money off to tax havens, find loopholes in tax law (why U.S. tax law is so damn complicated), or some other way to get out of paying what is required by law. And guess what - when they even manage to fail like they did back in 2007-08, they have convinced the rest of society, the government that they need these bail outs because they are too big to fail. It&#39;s okay when they ask for financial support but for anybody else within society, good luck. <br><br>The reality that Parasite conveys at the end of the day is that everyone has blood on their hands. Every single consumer in a first world country to those even rising to the top. The only reason why people do not see it that way is because we have a monetary system that keeps things &quot;civil&quot; when in reality we have traded one bad thing for something worse - exploitation, low-paying wages, treating humans like machines, lying to employees by convincing them to work through bad circumstances, etc. Want to see an example of this? Watch Netflix&#39;s American Factory and see how NeoLiberal Capitalism accomplishes this... (I&#39;m sure the rich cannot wait for machines to be their full-time employees.

"...Video does a good job of pushing socialism and interventionism. I could debunk the misunderstandings about economics or the points where interpretations are willfully taken in a direction to push the narrative, but I&#39;ll go straight to the main point instead. The entire narrative is based on a set of premises that misses one extremely important key fact. One that makes the whole of the narrative crumble. For those that don&#39;t get it on their own, here goes:<br><br>If neoliberalism keeps rich people rich and poor people poor, and specially if the idea that poor people can become rich by effort is a constructed lie, as the narrative of the video claims, and as is reinforced in the video&#39;s description, where neoliberal capitalism is outright pointed as &quot;the boogie man&quot; of the film, then why the BRRT[A-10 sound] do we have examples of rich people becoming poor, and more importantly, of poor people becoming rich? Specially considering that the cases of poor people becoming rich only happen (to people who are not dictators or corrupt government officials, or affiliates to those) in capitalistic societies, and further, specially noting the direct correlation to economic freedom (ie, among other things, less bureaucracy and intervention)?<br><br>Why are the non-neoliberal, non-capitalistic societies that end up in economic, and thus eventually societal, disaster and ruin? While economic freedom and less government intervention is directly correlated to economic success and reduction of the poor?<br><br> ü§î  ü§î  ü§î  ü§î  ü§î<br><br>If you are in favor of (more?) interventionism of any kind, I&#39;ll ask you (any reader) to put your biases and (mis-?)conceptions about capitalism aside for a second, and think about this next point, and think about it seriously: Maybe, just maybe, it&#39;s <b>****not****</b> that the pro-captalism argument is based on ideas that the poor are parasites of the rich (as outright stated in the video at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgAK-4kPTb8&amp;t=12m51s"">12:51</a>), but rather, based on the realization and understanding that:<br><br>EVERYONE is affected by taxation. SPECIALLY the poorer, at any given wealth level, since the richer (at that wealth level or the ones above it) can offset the cost of taxation by pushing it down the suply/demand line through raising the prices of their products, or avoid it entirely by moving their assets away somewhere with less taxation. The later case being specially bad for the poor, since now they not only have to deal with the cost of taxation, but they have to do so with less choice about their work and their pay (since some or all of the rich moved their assets, ie factories, ie jobs away). --- Basically, &quot;the rich&quot; is everyone, because everyone is rich to different extents; and &quot;the rich&quot; aren&#39;t retarded, and if you try to take money away from people, no matter what level of rich they are, they will do their best to preserve it.<br><br>If you are in favor of intervention in the economy or socialistic measures to &quot;help the poor&quot;, you are in favor of hurting people and businesses through taxation or bureaucracy. And if you are in favor of hurting people and businesses, you are ultimately AGAINST the poor. Because:<br><br>---That very rich guy? Is not going to be taxed, or deal with bureaucracy on his businesses, more than he is willing to be; if you over-tax him or his company, he will move himself and/or his company away, along with all the related assets, because he can, and he doesn&#39;t have to deal with the BS you created.<br>---That not-so-rich guy? Same as the rich guy, except with more limited options. If you over-tax him or over-burden him, he might not be able to move away; but that small business that he planned to build with the money he managed to save from the past 5 years? Yea, he gave up on that for now, and the money is stuck in the bank earning him dividends to offset the higher taxes you directly or indirectly created.<br>---That kinda-poor guy? Same as the not-so-rich guy, except with even less options. He was working part-time, and spending the spare time getting himself a better education than he currently has in order to move up in life, but he got fired when the factory he worked at closed down to move to another state or country; turns out he was employed by the very rich guy who is moving his stuff away. So now he has to work full-time with over-time just to pay the bills, since, you know, there are less jobs and taxes are higher.<br>---That actually poor guy? He is either dying of hunger on the streets, or having to rely on charity (forced by government as, haha the irony, more taxes; or, preferably, voluntary), instead of being independent, thanks to <b>****not****</b> getting a job created, maintained, or freed by any of the guys above. All thanks to your intervention that was, ironically, intended to help him.<br><br>The reasons communism fails is not exclusive to communism. Economy, when left free, is self-regulating through supply and demand, and most problems people point to as being the fault of liberalism actually stem from interventionism. Lastly, unforeseen consequences are the bane of any interventionist idea or ideals. Socialists and interventionists aren&#39;t evil. I get where you come from. I was one of you not too long ago. But you have to realize that the economy goes a LOT deeper than your top-level, superficial analysis (and if you think your analysis is not superficial, you&#39;re wrong; because even the very best economist only has a superficial understanding of economics; there are so many factors that noone can claim they fully understand economics; and those who do are lying; that&#39;s how deep it goes). There are consequences to consequences to consequences (...). And your objective might be a utopia, but the paths that point toward those utopias, without exception, actually lead to either distopias or economic ruin.<br><br>If you want to learn at least the least-wrong path, it&#39;s to let the market self-regulate instead of trying to regulate it. And if you want to understand why, well, no one has the ultimate answer (those that claim they do, again, are lying), but Mises and the libertarians seem to have figured out a lot of this stuff. They don&#39;t know any magic answers to poverty, but at least they figured out what doesn&#39;t work and why, and statistics on economic freedom worldwide prove they are right or at least the least wrong.<br><br>Lastly, remember: The true enemy is not wealth inequity; it&#39;s lack of wealth. It really doesn&#39;t matter if the richest 1% can afford a f*****g interplanetary space-ship, if the poorest can afford a house and a car. It&#39;s when the rich go away, together with the jobs they create, and the poor are struggling to feed, that we get the real problems. --- Wealth distribution often presents itself as an exponential curve on a truly free market. The poor are many, and the rich are few and REALLY rich. And so people often think that that must be the root for the problem of poverty, when actually, it&#39;s not. The problem is how low is the bottom at the start of the distribution. And counter-intuitively, often, the easier it is for the rich, and more of &quot;the rich&quot; there are, the higher that bottom also is, and the less poor are &quot;the poor&quot;.",video good job pushing socialism interventionism could debunk misunderstandings economics points interpretations willfully taken direction push narrative straight main point instead entire narrative based set premises misses one extremely important key fact one makes whole narrative crumble get goes neoliberalism keeps rich people rich poor people poor specially idea poor people become rich effort constructed lie narrative video claims reinforced video description neoliberal capitalism outright pointed quot boogie man quot film brrt sound examples rich people becoming poor importantly poor people becoming rich specially considering cases poor people becoming rich happen people dictators corrupt government officials affiliates capitalistic societies specially noting direct correlation economic freedom among things less bureaucracy intervention non neoliberal non capitalistic societies end economic thus eventually societal disaster ruin economic freedom less government intervention directly correlated economic success reduction poor favor interventionism kind ask reader put biases mis conceptions capitalism aside second think next point think seriously maybe maybe pro captalism argument based ideas poor parasites rich outright stated video href https www youtube com watch zgak kptb amp rather based realization understanding everyone affected taxation specially poorer given wealth level since richer wealth level ones offset cost taxation pushing suply demand line raising prices products avoid entirely moving assets away somewhere less taxation later case specially bad poor since deal cost taxation less choice work pay since rich moved assets factories jobs away basically quot rich quot everyone everyone rich different extents quot rich quot retarded try take money away people matter level rich best preserve favor intervention economy socialistic measures quot help poor quot favor hurting people businesses taxation bureaucracy favor hurting people businesses ultimately poor rich guy going taxed deal bureaucracy businesses willing tax company move company away along related assets deal created rich guy rich guy except limited options tax burden might able move away small business planned build money managed save past years yea gave money stuck bank earning dividends offset higher taxes directly indirectly created kinda poor guy rich guy except even less options working part time spending spare time getting better education currently order move life got fired factory worked closed move another state country turns employed rich guy moving stuff away work full time time pay bills since know less jobs taxes higher actually poor guy either dying hunger streets rely charity forced government haha irony taxes preferably voluntary instead independent thanks getting job created maintained freed guys thanks intervention ironically intended help reasons communism fails exclusive communism economy left free self regulating supply demand problems people point fault liberalism actually stem interventionism lastly unforeseen consequences bane interventionist idea ideals socialists interventionists evil get come one long ago realize economy goes lot deeper top level superficial analysis think analysis superficial wrong even best economist superficial understanding economics many factors noone claim fully understand economics lying deep goes consequences consequences consequences objective might utopia paths point toward utopias without exception actually lead either distopias economic ruin want learn least least wrong path let market self regulate instead trying regulate want understand well one ultimate answer claim lying mises libertarians seem figured lot stuff know magic answers poverty least figured work statistics economic freedom worldwide prove right least least wrong lastly remember true enemy wealth inequity lack wealth really matter richest afford interplanetary space ship poorest afford house car rich away together jobs create poor struggling feed get real problems wealth distribution often presents exponential curve truly free market poor many rich really rich people often think must root problem poverty actually problem low bottom start distribution counter intuitively often easier rich quot rich quot higher bottom also less poor quot poor quot,positive

"Hi, good video, definitely dropping a like and subscribing. However, I want to pick out one fallacy that you put forward which is probably due to your own Eurocentrism and possibly a bit of projection and lack of cultural awareness. Light skin has been a beauty standard in many cultures but particularly in East Asian cultures since ancient times. The Geisha&#39;s white make-up were not inspired through some sort of masochistic reverence for European white skin for instance. In fact, this light skin beauty paradigm is actually more relevant to your analysis than you might realise.  It is better explained through class; as people with darker skin/tans were usually the worker-class who stayed in the sun all day and did all the dirty, sweaty, hard-work so darker skin -&gt; lower class, light skin -&gt; upper class. This is a beauty standard deeply rooted in many cultures in Eurasia and the Middle East and has very little to do with colonialism as you purport in your addendum. In fact, if we were to go down the rabbit-hole of colonialism in the case of Korea, they were only ever subjugated by other east Asian dynasties like Imperial Japan, Mongols and various Chinese dynasties.",good video definitely dropping like subscribing however want pick one fallacy put forward probably due eurocentrism possibly bit projection lack cultural awareness light skin beauty standard many cultures particularly east asian cultures since ancient times geisha white make inspired sort masochistic reverence european white skin instance fact light skin beauty paradigm actually relevant analysis might realise better explained class people darker skin tans usually worker class stayed sun day dirty sweaty hard work darker skin lower class light skin upper class beauty standard deeply rooted many cultures eurasia middle east little colonialism purport addendum fact rabbit hole colonialism case korea ever subjugated east asian dynasties like imperial japan mongols various chinese dynasties,positive

"Sorry but the statement that  &quot;Neo-Liberal capitalism takes economic responsibility away from the government and places it in to the hands of free-market institutions and private individuals&quot; is quite obvious nonsense.

It is in fact the government that must take that responsibility away from private institutions and individuals, those who make up the economy and thus collectively share the responsibilities of managing it. It is the government that must use force to intercede in the economy. Free-market capitalism is the natural state of human economic behavior, not some cruel invention imposed upon humanity, and the period in time in which economic responsibility was denied to the people who made the wealth by the government was the period we refer to as FEUDALISM. Which is exactly what these &quot;socialist&quot; and &quot;communist&quot; societies degenerate in to. The example you yourself have used of sweat shop factories in China, &quot;communist&quot; China, are proof of that. Feudalism only ended when power began to become dispersed, through democratic ideals, to the wider society.

This movie is deliberately pessimistic, but there are always stars of hope in the vast sea of darkness in the night sky.

The government should have nothing to do with individual success nor should we be rewarding people who do not work, I do think tho we should try and make our society function where if you work hard you will succeed which is how it was until global corporations created the real problems. The Parks may perpetuate unsavory ideals, but in no way were they deserving of death or violence merely because they looked down on poorly folk, they didn&#39;t actively try and push them down they just were employers to these people. And due to what they said about the lower class family that resulted in violence which I would say makes the poor family immoral and they got what was coming, not to say the rich family didn&#39;t get what they deserved either. In the end, capitalism is a good thing and DOES afford equal opportunities, there should never be equal outcome because in societies like that we see everyone ends up with nothing equally.

Theres thar false hope of social mobility that the film discusses. Yes a few people have gotten extremely lucky and used their limited connections to achieve class mobility. But what about the other 99.9% of others who are stuck beneath the boot of Neo-Liberal capitalism.

"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgAK-4kPTb8&amp;t=5m37s"">5:37</a> That&#39;s an interesting point, it made me realize that we see that a lot in the movie. Son ki-woo hiding beneath the rich girl&#39;s bed, the Kims hiding beneath the table as the parks are having sex above them. Having to endure the degradation of them talking about  the father&#39;s smell and being turned on by the daughter&#39;s underwear. Sitting through that scene was so mortifying, I can&#39;t imagine what actually being there and for the whole thing would have felt like. The contrast between those trying to survive beneath them and those enjoying something frivolous like perverted sex right above them also struck me (and then having to continue business as usual while pretending nothing happened). <br>And then there&#39;s of course those living in the basement beneath them, the parks completely oblivious to its existence and their existence, just as they are oblivious to those living in half-basements, enduring floods and practically living in the sewage(again symbolic to something beneath us that we ignore in everyday life, but allows us a safer, cleaner life above), while they enjoy the luxury of their isolation on their house on the hill. <br>Another interesting thing about this is how the kims are desperate  to keep the couple in the basement a locked secret while they walk above them, pretending to belong. Very symbolic to their situation and society in general and also relates back to what you pointed out about the struggle between the poor and poorer. <br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgAK-4kPTb8&amp;t=8m33s"">8:33</a> In another video about the movie someone pointed out that they expect them not to cross the line but constantly cross the line themselves. Like when they promptly ask them to join the birthday party, not really caring for their opinion or when mister kim is asked by mister park to perform for their child in a silly costume even though he clearly doesn&#39;t want to and it isn&#39;t his job. <br><br>What&#39;s really shocking about this movie to me is two things, the first is that the rich and the general public have not only learnt nothing after this, but never even realized what it is that took place the entire time. They&#39;ll probably continue living just thinking they were some crazy poor people and that poor people can&#39;t be trusted. They wouldn&#39;t care the daughter died, that the kims were injured, and one ended up trapped in a basement, or why. The father will never know there was a man living in a basement beneath him for years who admired him, and none of it will matter. <br>The second thing is that there was no happy ending for the kims, and wealth remained unobtainable, the final scene where it was presented as an illusion created the same sense of false hope for the audience as for the kims, only to then break it, leaving us in bleak basements and half-basements of false yearning, the kims worse off than before, in different states of ruin, from death to being locked up and torn apart, to being on the verge of insanity.",href https www youtube com watch zgak kptb amp interesting point made realize see lot movie son woo hiding beneath rich girl bed kims hiding beneath table parks sex endure degradation talking father smell turned daughter underwear sitting scene mortifying imagine actually whole thing would felt like contrast trying survive beneath enjoying something frivolous like perverted sex right also struck continue business usual pretending nothing happened course living basement beneath parks completely oblivious existence existence oblivious living half basements enduring floods practically living sewage symbolic something beneath ignore everyday life allows safer cleaner life enjoy luxury isolation house hill another interesting thing kims desperate keep couple basement locked secret walk pretending belong symbolic situation society general also relates back pointed struggle poor poorer href https www youtube com watch zgak kptb amp another video movie someone pointed expect cross line constantly cross line like promptly ask join birthday party really caring opinion mister kim asked mister park perform child silly costume even though clearly want job really shocking movie two things first rich general public learnt nothing never even realized took place entire time probably continue living thinking crazy poor people poor people trusted care daughter died kims injured one ended trapped basement father never know man living basement beneath years admired none matter second thing happy ending kims wealth remained unobtainable final scene presented illusion created sense false hope audience kims break leaving bleak basements half basements false yearning kims worse different states ruin death locked torn apart verge insanity,positive

"LandAhoy Exactly! i‚Äôve seen many people watch this and they only take away that the kims are parasites and the ‚Äòbad guys‚Äô that are leaching off the parks. but thats missing the whole point of the movie. although the parks never outright do something purposefully wrong or bad, all of their actions are done out of privilege, ignorance, and they are never worried about doing something wrong because they are the ones who hold authority over others (like the kims). This movie doesn‚Äôt have any villains but rather it just shows what class can do to people and a society.  To me, I cant get over the scene where ki-jeong has gotten stabbed and dasom fainted and the Park family and their friends dont even care but are just thinking of themselves, and the park family‚Äôs dad is just yelling for the keys so they can get out of there and they can help their son, while they‚Äôre employee is dying.

"I think the movie is hugely misinterpreted by a lot of people - unfortunately as well in this video, although I liked it as food for thought. Parasite of course critiques modern society and decreasing social mobility. But it does not critique captialism per se. Parasite doesn&#39;t construct a class conflict, it instead shows (yes, like you said in your video) the ignorance of the rich for the struggles of the poor and the fighting between the poor to achieve the status of the rich. But it doesn&#39;t critique the system as well, it just shows that there is no way to move up in socioeconomic status. But there&#39;s an important distinction between critiquing this and constructing class conflict. Parasite shows the moral ambiguity of both, the Kims and the Parks, they&#39;re both Parasites to each other. The takeaway of the film is basically, that, within the system, the rich should be interested in enabling social mobility - of which the visual symbol of stairs is very present in the film - and open their eyes for the struggles of the poor in order to continue living their lifestyle. Because ultimately, the Parks pay the price for their ignorance - of course the Kims do as well. Both are losers of the increasing divide and the fight for a better socioeconomic status. I also think that this interpretation better fits the situation in South Korea as well as Bong Joon-ho&#39;s other work. (SPOILER) In Snowpiercer, for example, there is a big revolution at the end of the movie, the system is overthrown. But the result is, that the train derails and everybody dies at last. Everybody loses. We also have to interpret Bong&#39;s works with the current political landscape of South Korea in mind. Yes, there is a big divide between rich and poor, yes, there are no big safety nets for people like social systems in Europe (where I am from, btw). But there is also the very real negative example of a different economic system nearby: North Korea. Capitalism is engrained in South Korea and it is the main reason for the stellar rise of the country since the Korean War. Capitalism is not a bad &quot;ideology&quot; in South Korea, instead the current, negative development of capitalism proves dangerous for society, and this is what Parasite essentially critiques. Capitalism is neither bad nor good, it is essentially empty and what people make of it. South Korea has seen what good Capitalism can do, so Bongs Films would be far from critizising this very system and constructing a class conflict that any class can win and profit of.<br>I think Parasite is often misunderstood especially in countries like the US where there is a lack of social security systems or basic social democratic policy. But Parasite does not critique the system of capitalism itself, it does not pit two classes against each other, and when it does, it shows that no one can benefit from overthrowing the system or any sort of revolutionary act. At least that is my interpretation, and I personally think (of course I am biased) that I do have the arguments to support my interpretation here.",think movie hugely misinterpreted lot people unfortunately well video although liked food thought parasite course critiques modern society decreasing social mobility critique captialism per parasite construct class conflict instead shows yes like said video ignorance rich struggles poor fighting poor achieve status rich critique system well shows way move socioeconomic status important distinction critiquing constructing class conflict parasite shows moral ambiguity kims parks parasites takeaway film basically within system rich interested enabling social mobility visual symbol stairs present film open eyes struggles poor order continue living lifestyle ultimately parks pay price ignorance course kims well losers increasing divide fight better socioeconomic status also think interpretation better fits situation south korea well bong joon work spoiler snowpiercer example big revolution end movie system overthrown result train derails everybody dies last everybody loses also interpret bong works current political landscape south korea mind yes big divide rich poor yes big safety nets people like social systems europe btw also real negative example different economic system nearby north korea capitalism engrained south korea main reason stellar rise country since korean war capitalism bad quot ideology quot south korea instead current negative development capitalism proves dangerous society parasite essentially critiques capitalism neither bad good essentially empty people make south korea seen good capitalism bongs films would far critizising system constructing class conflict class win profit think parasite often misunderstood especially countries like lack social security systems basic social democratic policy parasite critique system capitalism pit two classes shows one benefit overthrowing system sort revolutionary act least interpretation personally think course biased arguments support interpretation,negative

When the Park‚Äôs had to leave the campsite Dasong insists on having Jjappaguri (ramdon) so the mom will call home in order to give heads up for the old maid to get out of the house. My two more cents on Dasong is that he represents the young generation of today who know the plea of the less fortunate people. Dasong sees the light flickering and sees the ‚ÄúHELP!‚Äù sent by the man in the basement. Like the young generation of this day Dasong does not have the money or the power to save such people. It is ironic because it is the young generation who feel such empathy but they do not have the means to save the poor.

"The sociological analysis starting at min 4 of your video is pretty good, however I would disagree with some of the assumptions. While it is important to raise issues of poverty and exploitation, I think its equally important to keep in mind the context, Korean society is much less meritocratic than western societies, throughout the film the director shows us just how capable the family acting as servants really are, often showing them as more capable than the Parks.  However,  the core issues in the U.S. and europe are not the same, while some capable people are certainly excluded from growth and wealth, the reasons for their exclusion have more to do with low labour mobility (i.e. the difficulty and cost of moving to cities where they could earn more) and the high cost of living in economically vibrant areas. With regards to Apple&#39;s exploitation of Foxconn factory workers I agree that bad working conditions should be corrected, but it is equally important to consider how literally millions of chinese farm workers went form struggling to feed themselves, to having access to education and opportunity, please read Factory girls, its a great account of the individuals we tend to look down on in the west, it shows just how creative, hard working, and ambitious these people are, and more importantly how these factory jobs enabled them to fulfil their dreams, and lead happier lives.

"Parasite is a hopelessly naive and simplistic movie. The so-called &quot;elite&quot; class is not monolithic. It is heavily stratified with constant movement, conflict and - more often than people are willing to admit - violence at the interfaces. If this were anything approaching reality the rich family would be as concerned with holding on to their position and/or attempting to ascend the next rung of the ladder as the poor one. I&#39;m not sure how much you have read of people like Gramsci but given the context into which you&#39;ve embedded the quote I question whether you&#39;ve understood any it. I see you have quoted Doug Kellner who I know from way back in Austin (before he came to the conclusion that if you can&#39;t beat them - join them). Unless he has changed a great deal since he became all &quot;civilised&quot; I&#39;d argue he&#39;d take a rather jaundiced view of Bong - who affects to be a critical observer outside the socio-political framework but whether he understands it or not (&quot;We allow you to make the films in which you say what you like <b>BECAUSE</b> we like what you say&quot;) in his attempts to undermine societal norms he simply re-enforces them.<br><br><br>I mean, faced with being returned to a &quot;free&quot; but precivilised age as his protagonists are at the end of Snowpiercer after they overthrow the tyranny of the train most people living today (who could scarcely survive twenty four hours in nature no matter how many episodes of Bear Grylls they&#39;ve watched) wouldn&#39;t think twice about leaving - regardless of their miserable existence. And yet Bong is presenting a completely bogus false dichotomy which some might argue serves little purpose but to prop up the status quo. <br><br>By the way - with the exception of a half-a-dozen families whose heritage can be traced all the way back to the Crusades just about everyone in the elite class at some point began scratching out a living at the very bottom rungs of the ladder.  This pathway has always existed - and it always shall. Indeed in countries such as the United States, Britain and France sufficiently talented members of the working class are feted and recruited (usually within the University/High School system) and fast-tracked into positions of responsibility (think of Richard Nixon or John Major). Contrary to your argument it has <b>never</b> been difficult to accrue wealth. It&#39;s comforting to pin the blame entirely on the upper elites for conspiring at every turn to thwart progress toward the wealth and happiness you unquestionably deserve when the reality is you chose not to pursue this end because the cost was too high. When I say &quot;cost&quot; I&#39;m not talking about enthusiasm, labour or money. I&#39;m talking about the cost to your humanity - or to use religious terminology - your immortal soul. And once you step over that line there&#39;s no going back. &quot;Successful&quot; people have the capacity to compartmentalise this cost and continue to function. But most people can&#39;t. There have been many opportunities in my life when I have turned down opportunities to make a great deal more money because I knew I couldn&#39;t live with the memory of screwing people over. An example of a far more sophisticated film (despite one or two flaws) which recognises this reality is David O. Russell&#39;s &quot;Joy&quot;.",parasite hopelessly naive simplistic movie called quot elite quot class monolithic heavily stratified constant movement conflict often people willing admit violence interfaces anything approaching reality rich family would concerned holding position attempting ascend next rung ladder poor one sure much read people like gramsci given context embedded quote question whether understood see quoted doug kellner know way back austin came conclusion beat join unless changed great deal since became quot civilised quot argue take rather jaundiced view bong affects critical observer outside socio political framework whether understands quot allow make films say like like say quot attempts undermine societal norms simply enforces mean faced returned quot free quot precivilised age protagonists end snowpiercer overthrow tyranny train people living today could scarcely survive twenty four hours nature matter many episodes bear grylls watched think twice leaving regardless miserable existence yet bong presenting completely bogus false dichotomy might argue serves little purpose prop status quo way exception half dozen families whose heritage traced way back crusades everyone elite class point began scratching living bottom rungs ladder pathway always existed always shall indeed countries united states britain france sufficiently talented members working class feted recruited usually within university high school system fast tracked positions responsibility think richard nixon john major contrary argument never difficult accrue wealth comforting pin blame entirely upper elites conspiring every turn thwart progress toward wealth happiness unquestionably deserve reality chose pursue end cost high say quot cost quot talking enthusiasm labour money talking cost humanity use religious terminology immortal soul step line going back quot successful quot people capacity compartmentalise cost continue function people many opportunities life turned opportunities make great deal money knew live memory screwing people example far sophisticated film despite one two flaws recognises reality david russell quot joy quot,positive

"&quot;In a capitalist society the prevailing conservative argument is that social democracy, higher taxes, and budget deficits take from the rich and give to the lazy&quot; Wrong. That is not the conservative argument atall and if liberals and Democrats would actually listen to the &quot;prevailing conservative argument &quot; which they&#39;ve always ignored they would know the real conservatives see certainly in the case of higher taxes that, that is theft from not only the rich but form everyone rich, middle class and the poor which never betters the class gap but deepens it while less government, indavidual achievement and yes hard work gets you to higher levels of success.  You are in effect under a capitalist system a self made person. Under socialism this is a near impossibility because everything under socialism is deincentive to getting out of poverty.  The government is so big under socialism that it treats everyone the same and takes from people the means to be a indavidual success and make money because the government is always slapping you down to keep you in equal standing with the rest of the working class. In other words. Its slavery without the chains .A good socialist becomes their own slave masters and becomes imprisoned by their ideology instead of good old fashioned common sense .",quot capitalist society prevailing conservative argument social democracy higher taxes budget deficits take rich give lazy quot wrong conservative argument atall liberals democrats would actually listen quot prevailing conservative argument quot always ignored would know real conservatives see certainly case higher taxes theft rich form everyone rich middle class poor never betters class gap deepens less government indavidual achievement yes hard work gets higher levels success effect capitalist system self made person socialism near impossibility everything socialism deincentive getting poverty government big socialism treats everyone takes people means indavidual success make money government always slapping keep equal standing rest working class words slavery without chains good socialist becomes slave masters becomes imprisoned ideology instead good old fashioned common sense,negative

"This is a weird interpretation of Parasite.  There are very few Marxists in SKorea.  I doubt the director was thinking along the line of the Marxist interpretation of this film as Broey Deschanel suggests.  Bong was probably thinking of something more practical and mundane as the fact that in Korea, particularly in Seoul, young people cannot hope to ever own their own homes, making it difficult for them to marry, have kids, and have a family.  Also, what is missing in the subtitle translation is the fact that Korean is a polite language.  This is an aspect of the movie translation that&#39;s gone totally missing.  In polite languages such as Korean and Japanese, language presupposes a whole host of social expectations.  In the subtitle translation, this aspect of social expectation is totally lost, as there&#39;s no such equivalency in the English language.  When watching the movie in Korean, it is Mr. Park&#39;s family who dare not &quot;cross the line.&quot;  Mr. Park&#39;s entire family shows proper respect for Mr. Kim&#39;s family members (in Korean).  What is happening in a consumer-oriented society, this traditional value of basic human decency is increasingly becoming blurred.",weird interpretation parasite marxists skorea doubt director thinking along line marxist interpretation film broey deschanel suggests bong probably thinking something practical mundane fact korea particularly seoul young people hope ever homes making difficult marry kids family also missing subtitle translation fact korean polite language aspect movie translation gone totally missing polite languages korean japanese language presupposes whole host social expectations subtitle translation aspect social expectation totally lost equivalency english language watching movie korean park family dare quot cross line quot park entire family shows proper respect kim family members korean happening consumer oriented society traditional value basic human decency increasingly becoming blurred,negative

Neither did the brother, who did very well in school but cannot go to university. The kids they were tutoring were just born into wealth the same way they were born into poverty. And so by random luck one set of kids have access to the best schools (he can pay the fees or he could literally pay their way in or they could get a leg up in applications if their parents are important enough or donate enough money to the school) and tutors and resources. If they want an internship their dad can connect them and they can afford to work it unpaid, if they want to start a business he can lend them a few million dollars or probably has good credit. They can get the right clothes to impress at an interview, they were probably able to prep or have powerful connected people to represent them.

From the interior of the sub-basement one would think they were not always a poor family, despite the father being constantly compared to a bug.<br>Another two interesting points that I saw in another video: the cinematography often uses physical lines (glass panes, corners of the room, and other architectural elements) to visually seperate the Park&#39;s from their servants. Watch it again and it&#39;s hard to miss. Also, I found it very interesting that somebody mentioned the little boy&#39;s obsession with Native Americans. Could this be a reference to how the Park family is completely oblivious to those scheming to invade their territory?<br><br><br>This movie has so many layers, it will occupy my mind for a while. Although it did bother me that at times the social commentary seemed to overrule common sense. Like how when the rich parents lay down on the couch and the poor family is hiding under the table, he smells the father rather than all the bottles of alcohol they broke half an hour earlier. And the plan at the end might seem like a wonderful way of conveying the broken American dream, but wouldn&#39;t he just go and help his father escape the next night rather than going through some outlandish and abstract plan?",thought interesting family living sub basement still see superior family living basement like father blaming man living without plan famously never makes plan reference people considering middle class middle class collapsing years lower class interior sub basement one would think always poor family despite father constantly compared bug another two interesting points saw another video cinematography often uses physical lines glass panes corners room architectural elements visually seperate park servants watch hard miss also found interesting somebody mentioned little boy obsession native americans could reference park family completely oblivious scheming invade territory movie many layers occupy mind although bother times social commentary seemed overrule common sense like rich parents lay couch poor family hiding table smells father rather bottles alcohol broke half hour earlier plan end might seem like wonderful way conveying broken american dream help father escape next night rather going outlandish abstract plan,positive

"I mean, Foxconn is contracted by many other tech giants to build their products too, to focus solely on Apple is a moot point. I have relatives that live in Hong Kong, who were up in Shenzhen to work at those factory campuses. The socioeconomic condition means that they believe the work they endure is a fact of life. It is highly exaggerated by the west of being close to &#39;slave labour&#39; when the skill level of work is relative to how they are paid. A lot of the western criticism does not take into consideration that standard of living and affordability is very different to the west and people live in relative comfort, not so concerned about being &#39;in poverty&#39;. The scandals at Foxconn only picked up and escalated in the media when locals started to pick up that the conditions were not to a &#39;western standard&#39; and workers started to develop mental health symptoms by way of exposure. As an inductive example, one of my cousins that worked at the campus that focused mainly on Microsoft products like keyboards and mice, saved enough to travel a bit with his girlfriend. This was his first time going overseas, and to Australia in fact. He returned, and couldn&#39;t last in the same job for more than two months and started developing symptoms of depression shortly after. The other cousin was actually stationed at one of the Foxconn factories that assembled for Apple. I used to remember him complaining about some of his fellow workers would slack off and hold up their entire line and get hated on by that whole team. You don&#39;t hear anything about about these things in the west. It&#39;s more local media stuff. The west is focused on pushing class-warfare, and profiting from the lower, middle-class outrage.

"I&#39;d like to add some thing myself <br>They might be far fetched but this movie gives us a lot of space to do so. <br>1) Regarding the rich mother falling asleep in two random moments. This might be a mocking because she does nothing and still falls asleep, while the working class is tired so people fall asleep from lack of it or she is so bored she has nothing to do, that she falls asleep again in contrary to others that have too much to do and thus get exhausted. <br>2) Again this might be far fetched but it&#39;s just my point of view. The man in the basement, the one that has been there for 4 years is a very good representation of North Korea. He lives so close to the rich ones, yet they don&#39;t know him at all because he is hidden there, far from the rest of the world. He is eating barely enough to survive yet still feels thankful for Mr. Park who is &#39;feeding&#39; him yet Mr. Park doesn&#39;t even know him. His life&#39;s purpose is to do use light patterns as an ode to his greatness. The fact that his wife did a news reporter from N.Korea and did it so well, according to him, further proves those two are connected. <br>3) The main character (the poor son) is eventually most of us. Capitalism promises that by hard work, everyone will be able to succeed. Just like the rest of us, he wants to work well and make money, to get his dad out of there. To &#39;raise&#39; him, from the basement to the top. We all want a better future for our parents, to please them for everything they&#39;ve given us. Especially in Korea, as far as I know, kids tend to be close with their parents even when they get older. However, the son never makes it. His son won&#39;t make it as well. and so on and so on. Unlike Capitalism&#39;s promise, it&#39;s a state that can hardly change. <br>4) The boundaries about the rich father what talking about. It gives me goosebumbs to think that he said something along the lines of &#39;Mr Kim has been close to crossing the line but never does so&#39; yet at the end of the movie he does, comes really close to him, in the most aggressive way possible.

"Hi everyone! Wow thank you so much for all the kind comments it&#39;s really cool to see people engaging with the video :) I just wanted to address two things: 1) I apologize if my skin whitening example came off as Eurocentric. I should have acknowledged that the aspiration for paleness in certain places has deep historical/cultural roots. However, I used that example because the desire for whiter skin is not just limited to East Asia, and there is no way that this can be divorced from a long history of colonialism that has impacted so many cultures around the world - not to mention contemporary beauty standards promoted through global mass media. I myself am half Guyanese, and the colourism that exists in our culture is historical, but it is also very much entangled with Eurocentrism.  2) Many people have argued that capitalism is at least better than its alternative: communism. I never once mentioned communism in this video and I made an effort to specify that I&#39;m talking about neoliberal/late capitalism. I (personally) believe more government intervention and a more robust social safety net is a viable answer to an untethered and deregulated free market system. The Scandinavian countries are a great example - and if you&#39;re looking for somewhere more diverse - even Canada (although it&#39;s far from perfect) has a pretty strong social system. Corporations need to be held more accountable and should never have more power than a government in my opinion. Anyway - thank you all for the support, I really appreciate it! :) I hope to make videos more frequently in the future! <br><br><br>Also - I know my audio is iffy but the constant comments about it are a little melodramatic.

"Hi there. I&#39;m half Indian. I&#39;ve seen a lot of comments like this saying that that Asian skin whitening has nothing to do with Eurocentric beauty standards. I made that statement in the video because there is absolutely no way you can make the argument that the aspiration for whiteness in Asian cultures is completely divorced from Eurocentrism. The colourism that exists in my culture/family has deep historical roots, but it is also very much entangled with a long history of colonialism and contemporary beauty standards. In addition, skin whitening does not just occur in Asia. As to your second critique, I am making an analysis based on what Bong presented to us in his movie - whether the nihilistic ending was for theatrical purposes or not.

"While I loved the film, I don&#39;t particularly like how everyone is tearing into the very core of capitalism as if it isn&#39;t actually more beneficial to society as, lets say, communism. But while I feel strongly about that, that is not to say that capitalism doesn&#39;t triumph over communism in SOME of the worst ways; and that being harsh status difference that separates the rich from the poor. Most middle class people are likely to stay at their staus, but have a chance at becoming rich, while having a slim chance of landing in poverty, while most impoverished people are stuck. I feel like this movie did highlight why the impoverished suffer from being so stagnant, because while they may be skilled, their inability to afford school or (mostly) college can leave them where they are until someone along the line breaks off from the chain. <br><br>But again, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s black and white. Capitalism isn&#39;t inherently evil, but I don&#39;t believe there is such a thing as a perfect system either. Again though, as much as I am for capitalism, I feel like this movie did such a good job at pointing at many facets of economic status in society. Like, while there may not have been a middle class family in the mix, I do believe that Min, the friend who gave Ki-woo that tutoring job,  may have been the representation for that. I think it&#39;s safe to assume that he was that &#39;path&#39; for Ki-woo to reach higher, because as most middle class people, he has the opportunity to either stay where he is or become richer, and in this case he granted his friends entire family the chance to become higher just because of something simple as posing as a college tutor, which Ki-woo probably couldn&#39;t get into for whatever reasons (and this is just an assumption, but I&#39;m pretty sure that most colleges in Korea (I think) deeply scrutinize what school you came from to determine if you should be a student at their college. But feel free to correct me if I&#39;m wrong, I just often hear drama about &quot;you want to go to that school?! Won&#39;t college be hard to get into?&quot; kinda stuff.)",loved film particularly like everyone tearing core capitalism actually beneficial society lets say communism feel strongly say capitalism triumph communism worst ways harsh status difference separates rich poor middle class people likely stay staus chance becoming rich slim chance landing poverty impoverished people stuck feel like movie highlight impoverished suffer stagnant may skilled inability afford school mostly college leave someone along line breaks chain think black white capitalism inherently evil believe thing perfect system either though much capitalism feel like movie good job pointing many facets economic status society like may middle class family mix believe min friend gave woo tutoring job may representation think safe assume path woo reach higher middle class people opportunity either stay become richer case granted friends entire family chance become higher something simple posing college tutor woo probably get whatever reasons assumption pretty sure colleges korea think deeply scrutinize school came determine student college feel free correct wrong often hear drama quot want school college hard get quot kinda stuff,positive

"In my opinion  &quot;Parasite&quot; is one of the best movies in the last decade, and this analysis is simply brilliant, I agree 100% that every class lives through expenses of the other and what I loved the most is that the director neither idealize the Kim&#39;s nor condemn the Parks, is a very objective view with characters that have both virtues and defaults like real human beings, thank you so much for this contribution, however I think blaming capitalism per se for some of the problems the film points out is too symplistic and I don&#39;t see that&#39;s Bong Jo&#39;s intention. There are a lot of things that are not desirable in modern society however I have to ask this: what economic system is a better alternative ?? Socialism also has an upper class gathered in the dominant party. Myself as an inhabitant from a latin american country where state interventionism is still very strong I can tell you that politics which are oriented to a socialist model are everything but succesfull in order to improve people&#39;s lives, my dad grew up in a country without foreign companies around, without free market awareness and again in a land ruled by strong statism policies... he was miserable, he literally spent all his childhood living in a paperboard house and eating only twice a day, he had to  do all type of minor services by himself to afford his school and finally after many years of struggle he was in a much better situation however during his productive years there weren&#39;t many opportunities unless you were a friend of a politician, that was before we were &quot;invaded&quot; by neoliberalist policies.  There will always be better-paid jobs than others, simply because we as a society value unique talent more than low-skilled labor, I mean I agree we should be awared about social injustice and we can do a lot more to close the barriers but  I&#39;ve worked in the filming industry and in a production even if it&#39;s small there are hundreds of people involved and I&#39;m sure Mr. Bong Joon Ho has no remorse of him or his main actors earning more money than those others who had a lesser role by making his films besides he lives in a world where he doesn&#39;t have to be part of the top 1000 billionaires to enjoy a very decent level of life.  It&#39;s the way it is, as Churchill said: &quot;capitalism is the worst system except all others&quot;",opinion quot parasite quot one best movies last decade analysis simply brilliant agree every class lives expenses loved director neither idealize kim condemn parks objective view characters virtues defaults like real human beings thank much contribution however think blaming capitalism per problems film points symplistic see bong intention lot things desirable modern society however ask economic system better alternative socialism also upper class gathered dominant party inhabitant latin american country state interventionism still strong tell politics oriented socialist model everything succesfull order improve people lives dad grew country without foreign companies around without free market awareness land ruled strong statism policies miserable literally spent childhood living paperboard house eating twice day type minor services afford school finally many years struggle much better situation however productive years many opportunities unless friend politician quot invaded quot neoliberalist policies always better paid jobs others simply society value unique talent low skilled labor mean agree awared social injustice lot close barriers worked filming industry production even small hundreds people involved sure bong joon remorse main actors earning money others lesser role making films besides lives world part top billionaires enjoy decent level life way churchill said quot capitalism worst system except others quot,positive

"Excellent! What insightful analysis and thorough research! There&#39;s one thought I wanted to express, though: I feel like the cultural hegemony that the Kims have bought into has less to do with worshiping the upper class (I would argue that they look down on the Parks, and see them as nice but foolish) and more to do with their own pride. They&#39;ve had a taste of what it&#39;s like to have status and money, and now they will not let go of it, no matter what. Even if it means killing fellow workers, they will keep climbing the &quot;social staircase&quot; (notice the visual metaphor in the film of the two families racing to the top of the bunker stairs, dragging each other down). In this sense, I believe capitalism has taught them not to be content with servitude, but to claw their way to the top.<br><br>I actually am writing a paper on this as my college integrative project (incorporating Marx and Rousseau), so it&#39;s definitely good to see other folks doing their research and finding the deeper meanings behind Parasite! What a fantastic film, truly. I will check out the sources you quoted and see if I can incorporate them in my bibliography.",excellent insightful analysis thorough research one thought wanted express though feel like cultural hegemony kims bought less worshiping upper class would argue look parks see nice foolish pride taste like status money let matter even means killing fellow workers keep climbing quot social staircase quot notice visual metaphor film two families racing top bunker stairs dragging sense believe capitalism taught content servitude claw way top actually writing paper college integrative project incorporating marx rousseau definitely good see folks research finding deeper meanings behind parasite fantastic film truly check sources quoted see incorporate bibliography,positive
"@Broey Deschanel Oh yes definitely there is a bit of a love-hate dynamic going on between  the two families. The Kims believe themselves to be better than the Parks on some level, because they are smarter, or at least more wily. On the other hand, they are jealous of the Parks&#39; wealth and status. They&#39;ve seen the privileged lifestyle of this bourgeois family and want it for themselves. This is what leads the Kims to thinking of the house as &quot;their house,&quot; even though it will never actually be theirs. They feel entitled to it because they are starting to believe they can integrate into the world of the Parks (through the means of Kiwoo marrying Dahye). So on some level they hate these snobby rich people. But they also want to be them, as we see with Kiwoo&#39;s fantasy at the end. No matter what, money always corrupts. Even though the poor may despise the rich, they still desire that lifestyle for themselves (which is hypocritical of course, but very human).",broey deschanel yes definitely bit love hate dynamic going two families kims believe better parks level smarter least wily hand jealous parks wealth status seen privileged lifestyle bourgeois family want leads kims thinking house quot house quot even though never actually feel entitled starting believe integrate world parks means kiwoo marrying dahye level hate snobby rich people also want see kiwoo fantasy end matter money always corrupts even though poor may despise rich still desire lifestyle hypocritical course human,positive
"That&#39;s a great interpretation, perhaps that&#39;s truly what&#39;s going on here.

IN CONCLUSION COMMUNISM !!!,conclusion communism,neutral
"First, I would like to say wow, this analysis took a lot of time and research which is highly commendable. However, because you are analyzing this movie from a very limited framework, you have missed out on the overall theme of this movie which isn&#39;t about capitalism, though it does play a part in it. It&#39;s easy to get stuck in this black and white mindset where society is constructed to keep rich people at the top and poor people at the bottom. Rich people are simply benefiting from a capitalistic system and poor people can never rise to the top. This simply isn&#39;t factually true. If you took less time looking over theories and more time looking at the research data you would see that the facts point to a different narrative. For example, intelligence is a bigger factor of success than socio economic status. In other words, a rich person born in poverty has a higher chance of becoming richer than a person of lesser intelligence born in wealth. There seems to be a wide variety of factors and there still needs to be more research. However, from what we do know, there are a few components that are seemingly crucial. One, you need to have emotional intelligence in order to take risks such as starting your own business. That means, having a stable supportive social support network so when you fail, you can keep going and learning from your mistakes. Not having a stable emotional support group as well as a poor emotional well being will greatly stifle your ability to do well. Second, you need to have the right personality. People who are open, disagreeable, and conscientious tends to make more money than those who aren&#39;t. In order words, you need to have an entrepreneurial mindset in order to attain a lot of wealth. If you are interested in studying and helping people instead of making money, then you won&#39;t make a lot of money because that isn&#39;t your goal. And of course, intelligence is probably the biggest predictor of wealth and unfortunately, this disadvantage is not socially constructed but naturally imposed. So in the end, yes, there is a clear inequality between rich and poor in modern capitalistic societies such as America but it seems to be inherited in natural injustices rather than socially constructed injustices. But even if you aren&#39;t intelligent, nor have the right personality to break into the 1%, it doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t live a comfortable and happy life because you don&#39;t need to smart or rich to be happy and happiness is a better end to strive for.",first would like say wow analysis took lot time research highly commendable however analyzing movie limited framework missed overall theme movie capitalism though play part easy get stuck black white mindset society constructed keep rich people top poor people bottom rich people simply benefiting capitalistic system poor people never rise top simply factually true took less time looking theories time looking research data would see facts point different narrative example intelligence bigger factor success socio economic status words rich person born poverty higher chance becoming richer person lesser intelligence born wealth seems wide variety factors still needs research however know components seemingly crucial one need emotional intelligence order take risks starting business means stable supportive social support network fail keep going learning mistakes stable emotional support group well poor emotional well greatly stifle ability well second need right personality people open disagreeable conscientious tends make money order words need entrepreneurial mindset order attain lot wealth interested studying helping people instead making money make lot money goal course intelligence probably biggest predictor wealth unfortunately disadvantage socially constructed naturally imposed end yes clear inequality rich poor modern capitalistic societies america seems inherited natural injustices rather socially constructed injustices even intelligent right personality break mean live comfortable happy life need smart rich happy happiness better end strive,positive
"I would have to disagree. Just because someone is intelligent does not guarantee they can climb the socio-economic ladder. You can see it in the film itself - Ki-Woo and Ki-Jeung are shown to be highly skilled and intelligent individuals, but neither of them is able to escape their socioeconomic situation. They stand in complete opposition to someone like (forgive me) Donald Trump, who is by no means an objectively intelligent individual, yet who amassed an empire based on economic status and connections alone. There are always external factors at play - did you parents have time to support and encourage your education? are you able to afford a better education? does your school have the resources/funding to provide adequate learning? does your government offer adequate funding? do you have to forgo your ambitions to take care of relatives? All of these combine to disadvantage someone from attaining higher socioeconomic status - wealth cannot be equated to innate biological qualities. Of course it&#39;s a socially constructed injustice, economic wealth itself is a manmade thing.",would disagree someone intelligent guarantee climb socio economic ladder see film woo jeung shown highly skilled intelligent individuals neither able escape socioeconomic situation stand complete opposition someone like forgive donald trump means objectively intelligent individual yet amassed empire based economic status connections alone always external factors play parents time support encourage education able afford better education school resources funding provide adequate learning government offer adequate funding forgo ambitions take care relatives combine disadvantage someone attaining higher socioeconomic status wealth equated innate biological qualities course socially constructed injustice economic wealth manmade thing,positive

"Thoughtful video that engages with the ideas and theories with great enthusiasm. I always enjoy these. Well edited, well argued. Brisk pace and gets large concepts across in an efficient way. This movie was terrific.<br><br>Let&#39;s go on a trip together. There&#39;s a number of things that prevented me from buying into an anlysis of this movie that is primarily sociological or economic. One is, if killing Mr. Park was a justifiable action according to this video&#39;s thesis, i.e. the wrongful oppression of many through cool capitalism and cultural hegemony which should be defied, how do we explain Mr. Kim&#39;s remorse and shellshock afterward? <br><br>There&#39;s a hint of Crime and Punishment in here which brings the movie beyond economic and sociological interpretation. Namely the individual psychology and personal struggle with aforementioned structures, cool capitalism, cultural hegemony, and with murder, personal corruption, exploitation of others, etc. Mr. Kim&#39;s human reaction to murder goes beyond economic and cultural analysis. The mere fact of being human confounds rational justifications. If cool capitalism and cultural hegemony are so wrong and deserve to be rebelled against, then why doesn&#39;t Mr. Kim revel in his victory? Because life is so much deeper than economic or sociological analyses. And I think, despite Bong&#39;s overt interpretations of his own film, that this movie argues that point at its core.<br><br>While I agree that there is a fearsome takeaway from this movie, I don&#39;t think the emphasis is placed on theoretical structures. Those things are pervasive in the movie and certainly frame it, but they take a backseat to the characters and the importance of personal conduct in the face of economic or social circumstances.<br><br>The movie contains, oddly, an archetypal hero myth structure in the falling action. The hero rescues his father from the underground, or at least aspires to do so. This is a reference to the power of the individual and how he can rejuvenate society by upright action. This points to a significant shift in Kevin&#39;s personality that suggests, retroactively, that the movie was foremost about Kevin&#39;s psychological journey and personal development, rather than an explication of economic and sociological concepts. I won&#39;t go into any great depth about this line of argumentation because of the limits of this format.

"@elliphant21 <br><br>Korea&#39;s economic situation is nothing short of a disaster. So shortly after its miraculous rise in wealth, it is now projected to enter permanent economic recession similar to Japan. Corruption plays a big role, as well as an aging demography and overdependance upon international trade. Nothing you&#39;ve brought up is false. Kiwoo may never be able to realize his explicit noble aspiration. In fact, he most certainly won&#39;t.<br><br>That lies outside my argument, however. I did not say he would be able to rescue his father. I said that he had experienced a personality shift that, maybe for the first time in his life, has lifted his eyes UP, changed his target to one that rises UP. There are many small steps to take, and along that steep and difficult path upwards, there is potential for personality growth and psychological development.<br><br>I&#39;ll repeat my point. The economic analysis which you&#39;ve put forward does not fully encompass Kiwoo&#39;s humanity. It&#39;s a cliche, but it rings true here: money does not buy happiness. Marcus Aurelius wrote, &quot;the happiness of your life depends on the quality of your thoughts.&quot; Kiwoo&#39;s thoughts--more, his entire perspective--has changed and put him on an upward trajectory. Again, upward in terms of his character and personal development. This brings in the symbol in the movie, the scholar&#39;s rock. Does it represent wealth? Or the qualities that make up a wealthy character? Kiwoo obsesses over this symbol throughout the movie and he understands it in the end.<br><br>There are many people like the Kims aiming DOWN. What happens when enough people, like Kiwoo, stop? The movie leaves this question hanging open.",elliphant korea economic situation nothing short disaster shortly miraculous rise wealth projected enter permanent economic recession similar japan corruption plays big role well aging demography overdependance upon international trade nothing brought false kiwoo may never able realize explicit noble aspiration fact certainly lies outside argument however say would able rescue father said experienced personality shift maybe first time life lifted eyes changed target one rises many small steps take along steep difficult path upwards potential personality growth psychological development repeat point economic analysis put forward fully encompass kiwoo humanity cliche rings true money buy happiness marcus aurelius wrote quot happiness life depends quality thoughts quot kiwoo thoughts entire perspective changed put upward trajectory upward terms character personal development brings symbol movie scholar rock represent wealth qualities make wealthy character kiwoo obsesses symbol throughout movie understands end many people like kims aiming happens enough people like kiwoo stop movie leaves question hanging open,positive
"ArtificialxSky you bring up some good points however, I think kiwoo‚Äôs aspiration to get rich in order to rescue his father is actually one of the most heartbreaking parts of the movie. bong said in an interview that it would take kiwoo 564 years to work and save enough to buy that house, which shows just how broken our socioeconomic system is. it seems reasonable that someone should be able to get out of poverty from their hard work alone, but in reality kiwoo is powerless against capitalistic society and will be stuck in the same metaphorical basement apartment until he dies. this myth of upward mobility only exists in our society so that the poor will continue to have hope in the system that exploits their labor and eventually kills them. this hope for future upward mobility upholds the system because the lower class is too busy trying to survive and get out of poverty to have an effective revolution that changes the system. bong uses kiwoo‚Äôs aspirations to show that whether an individual can climb the economic ladder does not matter because the cycle of class struggle will continue. kiwoo could become rich but the new tenants of his old family apartment will still get flooded out and the poor will continue to suffer while the ignorant rich continue to profit off the labor of the poor below them.",artificialxsky bring good points however think kiwoo aspiration get rich order rescue father actually one heartbreaking parts movie bong said interview would take kiwoo years work save enough buy house shows broken socioeconomic system seems reasonable someone able get poverty hard work alone reality kiwoo powerless capitalistic society stuck metaphorical basement apartment dies myth upward mobility exists society poor continue hope system exploits labor eventually kills hope future upward mobility upholds system lower class busy trying survive get poverty effective revolution changes system bong uses kiwoo aspirations show whether individual climb economic ladder matter cycle class struggle continue kiwoo could become rich new tenants old family apartment still get flooded poor continue suffer ignorant rich continue profit labor poor,negative

"Hi! I agree with what you&#39;re saying, although I think it might speak to a larger issue with theory and film analysis itself. When you apply a theory to a certain film, you&#39;re looking at it from a certain lens (in this case I looked at it from a socio-economic/cultural studies lens). I think it just requires multiple analyses and theories to observe the movie from different angles. Perhaps there&#39;s another theory that can explain why the Parks are victims. Maybe you could apply feminist film theory to explore Mrs. Park&#39;s character, or auteur theory to explore how Bong uses space/architecture to visualize his themes. But I don&#39;t think I could tackle all of the film&#39;s complex themes in a single video. I also agree that the relationship between the rich and poor is very complex and I don&#39;t think the Parks themselves are necessarily the villains of the movie, but actually the system they&#39;re living in (&quot;we live in a society&quot; lol). I also do think that the Parks&#39; ability to physically remove themselves from the situation/house does speak volumes, even if they&#39;ve experienced a traumatic situation.

Kim had no Big reason to kill Park and he never want to kill mr Park it just happened to him like a DREAM a BAD DREAM And he got punished for this because he did wrong he had to leave his family and stay in the bunker and later he also apologized to the park, but now nothing is going to happen with this apology, crime was already committed now he will have to atone for it ,this shows the jealousy and hatred of the lower class against the higher class, And the movie never justifies Kim&#39;s crime,Kim was not a psycho killer, he was a normal person, he committed this crime, which he regrets, but now nothing is going to happen by regretting,In the last, a conversation between a father and son is shown which is very emotional, a son will never consider his father a criminal He also knows that my father is not such a person, but nothing can happen now,In the end, the film ends on Hope, despite all this, ki woo never stops hoping,I don&#39;t know whether he will be able to get that house or not, but God bless him to buy such a house so that when it rains next time, he can enjoy it with his family like mr park does.<br>Both families were not parasite in this film the real parasite was human greed,hatred, jealousy and situation",parasite well written movie talks power greed hope says humans capitalist nature person thinks poor family power help poor think power hierarchy society one power considers one less power filth film talk privilege also higher class person gets everything lower class person work times get everything film well balanced villain film real villain situation yes bong give reason quot nothing quot whole point feels surprising murder mar park mar kim psychological act murder mar park mar kim surprising understand need understand psychology mar kim kim never wanted kill park situation led act jealousy anger already boiled kim mind park shown subtle way used respect park lot later came know thinks worker stinks alot thing deeply disturbing kim inside big truth already revealed front kim secret bunker right heard park say stinks later whole house got washed away rain trouble came upon one night still work morning park family enjoy birthday party still park treats like worker stinks completely unaware problem even geun killed kim daughter park thinking son logically think son first kim felt bad work park hatred park shrunk nose avoid smell kim felt worse situation suppressed hatred jealousy came form anger led murder park kim big reason kill park never want kill park happened like dream bad dream got punished wrong leave family stay bunker later also apologized park nothing going happen apology crime already committed atone shows jealousy hatred lower class higher class movie never justifies kim crime kim psycho killer normal person committed crime regrets nothing going happen regretting last conversation father son shown emotional son never consider father criminal also knows father person nothing happen end film ends hope despite woo never stops hoping know whether able get house god bless buy house rains next time enjoy family like park families parasite film real parasite human greed hatred jealousy situation,negative

"I felt like the Kim&#39;s family met their Karma, even though it was depressing and awful.. First off, the two kids could have kept up the deception and atleast saved and try to better their circumstances. The sister, Ki-jung  had stood a really good chance because she was clever, talented and impressed the Park family. But what put me off was that they had the house keeper and driver dismissed out of pure selfishness and greed. They capitalized  too much off the situation. The second thing was that they outright refused to help the previous housekeeper even when she offered to pay them, yet they were in the same class as her. Plus they were the reason for her being out of a job. What would it cost to feed a guy once a week, when they themselves were deceiving the Park family. None of them took into account the mental health or desperation of the housekeeper and her husband. SMH.   And what I couldn&#39;t understand, how comes no one thought of their home which was in a basement during a storm. They were so caught up on trying to leave a rich lifestyle that they forgot their own home.",felt like kim family met karma even though depressing awful first two kids could kept deception atleast saved try better circumstances sister jung stood really good chance clever talented impressed park family put house keeper driver dismissed pure selfishness greed capitalized much situation second thing outright refused help previous housekeeper even offered pay yet class plus reason job would cost feed guy week deceiving park family none took account mental health desperation housekeeper husband smh understand comes one thought home basement storm caught trying leave rich lifestyle forgot home,positive

The movie also shows that the poor aren&#39;t stupid, unqualified/unaccomplished or deserve to be poor --- they are just the vast majority who don&#39;t have the capital, the luck or other means to get further education, strike it in business, etc. because the post-capitalist world rewards the few and supresses the rest.

"No matter what wins any one single award, someone can always think of something that might be technically better and didn&#39;t get it. At the end of the day, something has to win and Parasite is a perfectly good movie with good writing, and a high degree of competency. For the year, I&#39;m not sure I can think of a better Korean film, or one that isn&#39;t better in some ways but worse in others. I also don&#39;t think anything about it was over-hyped. It pretty much came out of nowhere and had very little mainstream hype. <br><br>The 2nd point about the smelly insult. You are watching the moment he makes a turn as a character. You have to think of that whole sequence as being together processed by him. The sniff is the straw that breaks the camel&#39;s back. He&#39;s clearly realizing things during the whole sequence. I had some issues with it too. I wish he had come to his realizations and made the turn a bit sooner. I thought while he waited in the bushes he was going to have put it all together and would have reacted &quot;better&quot; sooner. But the sequence doesn&#39;t fail. And if we look in real life, people end up often make that turning point late and at odd times. I&#39;ve seen people put up with plenty of shit all day long, take in stride and be professional, but then go off &quot;get triggered&quot; because a tape dispenser is empty.

"Not a native English speaker so I am going to try my best.<br>First of all, let&#39;s give credit where credit is due: the movie is well shot, it builds some very artistic pictures at times, I find it funny, it has some cool metaphors, it&#39;s fast paced, accessible and enjoyable.<br>I also would like to assume that this is not an absurdist or surreal like film( stuff that you find in books written by Kafka, plays by Beckett or paintings by Dali, where common sense or logic are taken away for a specific purpose).<br>The action portrayed in the movie is supposed to be based on certain cause and effect situations, to make it realistic. Although, despite the general positive reviews that this movie has received, I&#39;m afraid this is not the case. Parasite is anything but plausible, and here is why:<br><br>-Rich families may be superficial, but if the Parks in Parasite represent a symbol for rich families for an universal understanding, then everything is wrong. Rich people are not stupid, I find it odd that they do not have security cameras or some kind of guards to keep the house safe in their absence. It does not seem plausible that mrs and mr Park simply agree to hire this poor family without any research of their interests, or background.<br>I find it odd that they did not know, even though they bought such a big house, that they did not have a basement.<br><br>-It feels wired that they got rid of the old housekeeper, in such a manner, that they truly believe she had TBC. The scene where mr Kim spills ketchup on the used napkin is very reminiscent of some cheap Mexican soap opera. And then he just touches mrs Park hand :&quot;Ah fuck it is just tuberculosis, relax&quot;<br><br>-Its absurd of how the Kims simply do all that mess when the Parks are away.<br><br>-The aspect that the old housekeeper just comes back, saying that she forgot smth in the basement( a fucking human being), with all kinds of bruises, cutting out the camera, does not add up.<br><br>-The fact that the Kims where really skilled and street smart does not make any sense on how they did not find jobs before.<br><br>-After their already implausible escape, when they return to their flooded home, the Kims return for the young son birthday looking flawless, after they spent that night in odd conditions.<br><br>-In the birthday scene, after the parody-like events, in life and death situations, mr Park is annoyed by the smell?<br>really? when his son is dying he just wants his car keys, like no one else from the guests drives a car.<br><br>And these are just a few of the facts that the movie doesn&#39;t get right, it feels awkward.<br>Let alone the political message, where the old housekeeper mocks and imitates North Korean politics.<br>The are also so many cliches, like the moment when the Kims stumble and they are seen by the old housekeeper, in that particular moment.<br>And one more thing, I know that this movie is full of metaphors, but what kind of crime investigation does not properly search ALL the house, basement included.",native english speaker going try best first let give credit credit due movie well shot builds artistic pictures times find funny cool metaphors fast paced accessible enjoyable also would like assume absurdist surreal like film stuff find books written kafka plays beckett paintings dali common sense logic taken away specific purpose action portrayed movie supposed based certain cause effect situations make realistic although despite general positive reviews movie received afraid case parasite anything plausible rich families may superficial parks parasite represent symbol rich families universal understanding everything wrong rich people stupid find odd security cameras kind guards keep house safe absence seem plausible mrs park simply agree hire poor family without research interests background find odd know even though bought big house basement feels wired got rid old housekeeper manner truly believe tbc scene kim spills ketchup used napkin reminiscent cheap mexican soap opera touches mrs park hand quot fuck tuberculosis relax quot absurd kims simply mess parks away aspect old housekeeper comes back saying forgot smth basement fucking human kinds bruises cutting camera add fact kims really skilled street smart make sense find jobs already implausible escape return flooded home kims return young son birthday looking flawless spent night odd conditions birthday scene parody like events life death situations park annoyed smell really son dying wants car keys like one else guests drives car facts movie get right feels awkward let alone political message old housekeeper mocks imitates north korean politics also many cliches like moment kims stumble seen old housekeeper particular moment one thing know movie full metaphors kind crime investigation properly search house basement included,positive

"Finally I find somebody that thinks like me about this film. I criticize the same aspects. The characters make thing that are extremelly out of their personality. The Kims demostrated to be extremelly smart and planning everything ahead, specially the kids. Then they make that stupid drunk party in the house risking loosing everything?. They let the old housekeeper just enters when they are all there with all the mess?.  The main character has demostrated during the movie be very smart and focus in the detais, planning everything in advance, and then at the end, he decides in the middle of a party, with tons of people in the house, to go to the basement? And alone?. Then, like you said, the police is not going to find the basement after 3 killing in the house, they dont think, where this guy came from?. Specially having blood in the accesible basement.<br><br>Then, like you say, the cliches, like hidding under the bed, forcing the situation that everybody goes downstairs when everybody in under the table. <br><br>I find very silly the ending of the killing in the garden. After all the entire story that the writter has been able to construct, is he ending it like that, with a silly metaphor?. <br><br>I normally would have seen this movie and said, Ok, it is a good movie, and go on. But all this crazyness with a 99% in rotten tomatoes, and all the comment just saying that is the best movie ever and this like that makes me feel that I am the only one that has seen the movie. <br>I do not see where this movie really is the best ever. <br>- In cinematografy is fine, but it is far far far from being better that 1917, or Birdman, or Interstellar, or a ton of movies more. <br>- The actors are fine, but sometimes they did it quite bad, with those silly over reactions in their faces. People speaks about this acting like if Daniel Day-Lewis made them. <br>- The script is not that good. The original idea is good but the developement, specially in the half part is not well develope, not at least to make as good as people say. The writter abuse a lot of take the character way out of their personalities to make them do thing that produce the situation that the writer is forcing. Then those silly non-funny cliches like the scene of hidding under the table werent necessary at all.<br>-The ending is just a metaphore that the writter wanted to make even when it makes no sense and it is a silly ending, when he could have done something much better to develope the situation with the guy in the basement. You want to see a good ending, check Seven. <br><br>At the end, a good movie, but come on guys, it is not that good, it is really far from be a all times master piece. Maybe this overreaction is due to the fact that the last two years has been quite bad in real memorable movies. Or maybe people feel a little bit identified with some aspects of the movie. I do know.<br><br>I feel like when I was recommended to see &quot;The mist&quot;, and when I check online the critics were throught the roof, and end up been one of the worst movies I have ever seen.",finally find somebody thinks like film criticize aspects characters make thing extremelly personality kims demostrated extremelly smart planning everything ahead specially kids make stupid drunk party house risking loosing everything let old housekeeper enters mess main character demostrated movie smart focus detais planning everything advance end decides middle party tons people house basement alone like said police going find basement killing house dont think guy came specially blood accesible basement like say cliches like hidding bed forcing situation everybody goes downstairs everybody table find silly ending killing garden entire story writter able construct ending like silly metaphor normally would seen movie said good movie crazyness rotten tomatoes comment saying best movie ever like makes feel one seen movie see movie really best ever cinematografy fine far far far better birdman interstellar ton movies actors fine sometimes quite bad silly reactions faces people speaks acting like daniel day lewis made script good original idea good developement specially half part well develope least make good people say writter abuse lot take character way personalities make thing produce situation writer forcing silly non funny cliches like scene hidding table werent necessary ending metaphore writter wanted make even makes sense silly ending could done something much better develope situation guy basement want see good ending check seven end good movie come guys good really far times master piece maybe overreaction due fact last two years quite bad real memorable movies maybe people feel little bit identified aspects movie know feel like recommended see quot mist quot check online critics throught roof end one worst movies ever seen,positive

I thought that the first three quarters of the film is really great, some fantastic visuals, and even dialogue that you have to remember, and do for stuff later. There is that fantastic surprise which is the height of the film. But from then on, I felt the film went down hill. It was so predictable. Also the last ten or so minutes could have really been trimmed. down. For me the best Korean film that I have seen is train To Busan, and zombie movies are not my cup of tea. For the first three quarters of the film, I though it was the greatest Korean him ever made. As for it winning the academy award as best picture, I felt that the Hollywood movie and Irishman were far better. No one has suggested it, but perhaps its best picture award was a backlash to the still Hollywood so white campaign.",glad listen whole review gave away something rather important thought first three quarters film really great fantastic visuals even dialogue remember stuff later fantastic surprise height film felt film went hill predictable also last ten minutes could really trimmed best korean film seen train busan zombie movies cup tea first three quarters film though greatest korean ever made winning academy award best picture felt hollywood movie irishman far better one suggested perhaps best picture award backlash still hollywood white campaign,positive

":::SPOILERS::: What is it with you americans going all hurray for that film??? With all due respect (and love for Hollywood and independent movie makers in the US): have you missed european cinemas since the seventies?!I was shocked when I heard it got an Oscar , no: THE Oscar! I didn&#39;t know anything about &#39;Parasite&#39; before watching it, so: perfect conditions, right? But I was not pleased. I liked the acting, tne camera work and art direction, but that&#39;s about it. I quite like the Korean movie scene too but this movie felt very european in a way, like one of those clever french comedies like &#39;Tanguy&#39; for example. But: I have seen so many better scripts, more absurd plots and more cruel (and better developed) twists in the last decades (yes I&#39;m old) that I was bored to hell in this one.<br>What is so fucking special, Bong Joon-ho did here? Admittedly, the basic idea is a neat one, but it goes nowhere. The characters acted like geniuses and improvised the bejesus out of them when the story needed it most - only to act like complete idiots: when the story needed it most. The only thing I did know when the film started (because I couldn&#39;t move my eyes fast enough away from the brief description) was that there is a plot twist. I hoped this would do the trick. For me it didn&#39;t. So there was a man hiding in the secret cellar. Wow. When they fell down the stairs so the real dramatic turning point that Joon-ho needed could occur I suffered a major second hand embarresment attack. That felt so insanly cheap I almost stopped watching. After that: why go dramatic after all?? Why have people dying????!!!! it made no sense. It was such an obvious and &#39;crafted&#39; surprise - like uuuuh, NOW everybody will be shocked - that I felt nothing but: C&#39;MOOOONs over and over again. Have the story escalate? Yeah sure, it desperately needed escalation at that point (and maybe before)! But why had it to be stabbing and thumping?! Don&#39;t get me wrong, I like my good amount of violence in a movie, but this felt so forced.<br>I don&#39;t hate that movie. It&#39;s worse. It bored me. And that&#39;s something I can never forgive ;)<br>Anyways, Chris, I just subbed, because I think you have a very engaging way of talking about movies, where both head AND heart are involved - like it should be in my opinion.

"This movie is kind of a Parasite.<br><br>Here&#39;s a movie that should have been nominated and should have won the Oscar:<br><br>&quot; The Laundromat &quot;<br><br>It&#39;s a movie, which feels like a really likable informational video about insurance fraud and tricky money schemes... Lol... Antonio Banderas and Gary Oldman are just so much fun to watch!!! It&#39;s a delightful film! Based on a true story, as well, about the Panama Papers.<br><br>For me, this beats other movies nominated for movie awards. It&#39;s an artwork, turning a boring subject into pure fun, with a unique way to tell a story and make a point as well. The characters have their ups and downs, as well.  It&#39;s a Steven Soderbergh project (I had thought he retired, so glad he didn&#39;t!) and his style lifts the story and turns it into an enjoyable ride that you want to be on. <br><br>Okay, I have nothing against &quot;Parasite&quot;,  but with all the English speaking great movies this year, why did this win so much at the Oscars?  It had good directing, great acting,  great score, interesting locations and good camera work --  but, I just didn&#39;t really believe the story that much. It seemed that the upper class folks were too naive, and the lower class folks were too lucky. Plus, what were the lower class family going to do once they were found out? After all, it was just a matter of time, right? The father of that family seemed to have a higher endurance, in my understanding of the character, but then he goes nuts because he finds out the upper class boss of his isn&#39;t fond of his &#39;smell&#39;? Seriously? This just seems silly to me. I thought he was more humble, and with more grit than to let something like that bother him. Is it realistic that the upper class in South Korea don&#39;t check on anyone that they hire? Seems unrealistic to me. So, I really wanted the movie to succeed (for me) by having the characters strike a deal with each other, or reconcile and make an agreement of some kind that brings The &#39;human experience&#39; to a higher level. But, instead, we got madness, chaos and murder. Wtf? I felt this was a complete cop-out. I&#39;m guessing that this movie may have a more relevant sense to it, culturally, for those from South Korea or living there. Because it may be drawing from a reality, there, that could be worth evaluating more deeply. I thought this was an average movie, because of the story. 5 out of 10.  Snowpiercer was more interesting, and better, from this Director.",movie kind parasite movie nominated oscar quot laundromat quot movie feels like really likable informational video insurance fraud tricky money schemes lol antonio banderas gary oldman much fun watch delightful film based true story well panama papers beats movies nominated movie awards artwork turning boring subject pure fun unique way tell story make point well characters ups downs well steven soderbergh project thought retired glad style lifts story turns enjoyable ride want okay nothing quot parasite quot english speaking great movies year win much oscars good directing great acting great score interesting locations good camera work really believe story much seemed upper class folks naive lower class folks lucky plus lower class family going found matter time right father family seemed higher endurance understanding character goes nuts finds upper class boss fond smell seriously seems silly thought humble grit let something like bother realistic upper class south korea check anyone hire seems unrealistic really wanted movie succeed characters strike deal reconcile make agreement kind brings human experience higher level instead got madness chaos murder wtf felt complete cop guessing movie may relevant sense culturally south korea living may drawing reality could worth evaluating deeply thought average movie story snowpiercer interesting better director,positive

"I&#39;m baffled at the amount of positive reviews this movie gets. I thought it was mediocre at best.<br><br>While I understood the plot of the movie, I didn&#39;t get why it was titled as &quot;Parasite&quot;. I mean, who is the parasite? Society teaches us that the rich are not, because they (the father in this case) work for a living. The poor can&#39;t be, since they work, too.<br><br>So either no one is a parasite or, if we accept the premise of the movie, that someone is a parasite, we must agree that everyone is a parasite. The poor family is parasitizing the rich family. The rich father has a business which may be a legal form of scam, parasitizing its (poor) customers. His wife is parasitizing him. Their children are parasitizing them.<br><br>Extrapolating, there is no such thing as a parasite in nature, because in the end, every being is a &quot;parasite&quot; on the back of other being(s) in one way or another. Life feeds on life. It&#39;s just the way it is...<br><br>Therefore, because the concept of parasitism is such an ambiguous one, I think it was a bad choice for the title of this otherwise pathetic excuse of a movie.<br><br>parasite:<br>- an organism which lives on the back of another organism of a different species;<br>- a person who exploits others and gives nothing in return.<br><br>Now the poor family may be labeled as malevolent cheaters, but cheater doesn&#39;t necessarily mean parasite.",baffled amount positive reviews movie gets thought mediocre best understood plot movie get titled quot parasite quot mean parasite society teaches rich father case work living poor since work either one parasite accept premise movie someone parasite must agree everyone parasite poor family parasitizing rich family rich father business may legal form scam parasitizing poor customers wife parasitizing children parasitizing extrapolating thing parasite nature end every quot parasite quot back one way another life feeds life way therefore concept parasitism ambiguous one think bad choice title otherwise pathetic excuse movie parasite organism lives back another organism different species person exploits others gives nothing return poor family may labeled malevolent cheaters cheater necessarily mean parasite,negative

"You answered how they are parasites in your later paragraphs buy ill recap. The poor family relies on exploiting the rich family to earn a living, doing so by scamming them and ruining the other house workers lives to replace them with their own family. The Rich family relies on the poor family to do the most basic of tasks to keep the home a livable place. They cant cook, do the dishes, or wash their own laundry. So in a way both families are parasites to each other. the twist of the movie serves as a grim reminder that it isn&#39;t just poor vs rich, but also poor vs poor as they battle for the welfare of the rich family. Being a parasite in the term you use isn&#39;t as simple as working or not working. Being caught up on simple issues like that hasn&#39;t allowed you to &quot;read in between the lines&quot; during your viewing of the movie.<br><br>You should give it a rewatch with that explanation in mind. Personally I think the film is great with amazing acting, writing, cinematography, and meaning. But it isn&#39;t perfect, it relies on deus ex machinas to push to the story along a little to much. But 100% a recommendation to anyone I know.",answered parasites later paragraphs buy ill recap poor family relies exploiting rich family earn living scamming ruining house workers lives replace family rich family relies poor family basic tasks keep home livable place cant cook dishes wash laundry way families parasites twist movie serves grim reminder poor rich also poor poor battle welfare rich family parasite term use simple working working caught simple issues like allowed quot read lines quot viewing movie give rewatch explanation mind personally think film great amazing acting writing cinematography meaning perfect relies deus machinas push story along little much recommendation anyone know,positive

Heck even the poor dad felt guilty of his actions. the director wanted to point out that as long as this inhumane class hierarchy of welth exists, very very bad things will definately happen to anyone, even the rich. it&#39;s not a matter of right or wrong, or who deserves what, it will happen.<br><br>even tho they try so hard, the rich family is highly disfunctional without the poors labor. however they draw an imaginary line between them and the poor. you can hate the poor hold them accountable for their action. but no matter what, once in a while an end of a knife blade will definately be headed towards you if this class system exists. the director wanted the ones who justify and lives(wins) upon this system to acknowledge that it horrible things may happen to them.",peeps moomoo get point initially followed yes ending intended make feel way never anybody deserving anything intention director famously admitted time time bad things happened poors conned lost jobs lost house lost dignity lost sense existing human reduced occupation function invisible rich whenever tried connect rich like asking loved asking handshake rich appeared offended even crossing line something justification killing heck even poor dad felt guilty actions director wanted point long inhumane class hierarchy welth exists bad things definately happen anyone even rich matter right wrong deserves happen even tho try hard rich family highly disfunctional without poors labor however draw imaginary line poor hate poor hold accountable action matter end knife blade definately headed towards class system exists director wanted ones justify lives wins upon system acknowledge horrible things may happen,negative

"I just saw the movie and I agree that it&#39;s fantastic and one of the best of the year, but that&#39;s a really long list for 2019. I just thought the massive plotholes were the only things keeping it from being a true masterpiece. Why didn&#39;t he just say &quot;hey my sister would be good for this?&quot; why did he have to pretend he didn&#39;t know her? They didn&#39;t seem to have already formulated the entire plot of bringing them all in, and I don&#39;t recall them ever mentioning why he didn&#39;t want them to know they were related. Also the buttons that controlled the lights were pretty unbelievable. Like why would that have been built that way? That was a huge MacGuffin that I found distracting when it came up. Also nothing ever came of the young boy decoding the message, so that seemed pointless. But despite all of that it was a great film and the acting and cinematography were near perfect.

"i didn&#39;t feel this movie was authentic. it&#39;s more like a movie was made to fit a particular social narrative, which actually hampers the authenticity of the story and the story feels forced. the poor family is extremely smart and skilled and it&#39;s unclear how they could be so poor with all that. .people who are smart and have little regard for ethics usually thrive in a market economy even if they start with less resources.  <br><br><br><br><br>certain situations and scenes seems highly unlikely (father not getting caught or the bunker not being found after such a horrific crime,  the father surviving in the basement for years without any external help, The family&#39;s extremely reckless behavior when the rich family goes out for just one night and equally reckless and stupid actions that makes them get caught to the previous house keeper, the son fully recovering - let alone surviving - two full blows to the head with a very heavy rock) and i feel these highly improbable situations are due to the film-maker trying to push the story to fit a particular social narrative. these are common in foreign movies that are made to a western market. i highly doubt the movie was equally well accepted by the S. Korean domestic audience. <br><br><br><br><br>the social critique too is ambiguous (if that was done purposely, it would be great, but i highly doubt it). for instance, i thought the person living in the bunker represented those who live from welfare. well is that a criticism of the welfare system? if it is, then maybe there&#39;s a point. but trying to justify the jealousy and anger of the poor family doesn&#39;t sit well. ultimately, a son saw his  father getting killed in front of him and a wife lost her husband for the only reason that they were rich and successful and somehow that doesn&#39;t count?  perhaps that guy worked his ass off to reach that position. resources don&#39;t just appear out of thin air. it&#39;s the same socialist destructive and negative mindset.  it looks like the poor family is just in that situation cos they never took responsibility for their lives and in some situations it&#39;s even suggested. and it&#39;s actually the poor family that doesn&#39;t give a shit about the fellow man and undercut other poor people (like the former drive and the land lady, the boy even steals his friend&#39;s gf who helped him land a job). somehow the rich guys are assholes bcos the wife is naive and the husband doesn&#39;t like the driver poking on his private life and doesn&#39;t&#39; like how he smells? common. all this is mixed up with a forced socialist message maybe to fit a western liberal audience so ultimately the social critique too loses its focus. <br><br><br><br><br>All in all, i think the film is overrated cos it tried to fit a particular social narrative and wasn&#39;t true to the story. it&#39;s a very common issue with modern movies. it&#39;s why even though these films are called &#39;masterpieces&#39; they never reach the levels of classics like &#39;seven samarui&#39; or &#39;12 angry men&#39; (or even &#39;Joker&#39;). cos rather than staying too to the story and characters, movies like this try to fit a contemporary political ideology, which compromises the integrity story and character development.<br><br><br>i liked the movie was switching genres throughout . it is something that can become a new trend.",feel movie authentic like movie made fit particular social narrative actually hampers authenticity story story feels forced poor family extremely smart skilled unclear could poor people smart little regard ethics usually thrive market economy even start less resources certain situations scenes seems highly unlikely father getting caught bunker found horrific crime father surviving basement years without external help family extremely reckless behavior rich family goes one night equally reckless stupid actions makes get caught previous house keeper son fully recovering let alone surviving two full blows head heavy rock feel highly improbable situations due film maker trying push story fit particular social narrative common foreign movies made western market highly doubt movie equally well accepted korean domestic audience social critique ambiguous done purposely would great highly doubt instance thought person living bunker represented live welfare well criticism welfare system maybe point trying justify jealousy anger poor family sit well ultimately son saw father getting killed front wife lost husband reason rich successful somehow count perhaps guy worked ass reach position resources appear thin air socialist destructive negative mindset looks like poor family situation cos never took responsibility lives situations even suggested actually poor family give shit fellow man undercut poor people like former drive land lady boy even steals friend helped land job somehow rich guys assholes bcos wife naive husband like driver poking private life like smells common mixed forced socialist message maybe fit western liberal audience ultimately social critique loses focus think film overrated cos tried fit particular social narrative true story common issue modern movies even though films called masterpieces never reach levels classics like seven samarui angry men even joker cos rather staying story characters movies like try fit contemporary political ideology compromises integrity story character development liked movie switching genres throughout something become new trend,negative

For example, uses a lot of cliches, like the typical scene of hiding under the table, or the uhhh surprise, now everyone decided to come downstairs. A lot of the decisions that the caracters make are just forced, including the ending. That is more typical of a comedy movie like American Pie. The main character, base in his personallity, would have never go down to the basement in the middle of a party, because during the movie the guy demostrate to be a masive planner, thinking out of everything, and then, he is doing that?. It is obvious that the writter was forcing the end there. You cannot see that in City of God, Seven, American Beauty, Good Will Hunting, etc. That is the biggest criticism that I have with the script, that forces situations abandoning the &quot;how that character would act in that situation&quot;. That is the equivalent of making Saul Goodman fall into a silly and obvious hustle. just to provoke a fast end or a comic situation. I am still looking for an actual deep review of the script, but for now, I can only find simplistic not based in the details reviews.",city god way better one parasites good movie good lot scenes example uses lot cliches like typical scene hiding table uhhh surprise everyone decided come downstairs lot decisions caracters make forced including ending typical comedy movie like american pie main character base personallity would never basement middle party movie guy demostrate masive planner thinking everything obvious writter forcing end see city god seven american beauty good hunting etc biggest criticism script forces situations abandoning quot character would act situation quot equivalent making saul goodman fall silly obvious hustle provoke fast end comic situation still looking actual deep review script find simplistic based details reviews,positive

"I enjoy your movie reviews, and sometimes I decide to watch movies because of you. You made me watch this movie, and thank you for that. After watching this movie at the theater, I was not able to stop thinking the movie that day. I am not sure whether you gonna post a Parasite extended spoiler review or not, but I want to share how I felt about the movie. I am originally from South Korea, so I got used to both US and Korean cultures. My understanding of the movie could be different from you. There are so many things to talk, but I believe water, a stone (scholar&#39;s rock), and ghosts are important symbols. <br>1) Water: Have you taken a shower with cold water? You can try just 1 minute very cold shower, not warm&amp; hot water. It initiates your fight or flight response and makes you discomfort. The drunk guy from the beginning of the movie got cold water to wake up. I think water reveals who they are here, and water naturally flows down because of gravity inevitably. The Kim&#39;s family&#39;s day-dream (to be rich) at the Park&#39;s house has ended with rain, and they confront a brutal reality. The Park&#39;s family reveal their disgust about the poor when raining <br>2) A stone (scholar&#39;s rock): I think the stone means superficial wealth or luxuries like a Gucci bag. There&#39;s no real use of the stone here, it is an object to show off. $3000 Gucci bag is useful or practical for a person who makes $3000 per month? probably not. In our daily life, media constantly tell you that you have to buy those items to look like a rich person. The media owned by rich people, tell you that the poor people are worthless, and the rich people should be respected. In the movie, the stone shows up when flooding, and it is like &quot;id&quot; (your primitive desire) emerges from &quot;superego&quot; (conscience, reality=water). The son in the movie can&#39;t hide his desire to be rich. His deep inside clings to the stone, thinks the poor is worthless even though he is one of the poor. <br>3) Ghosts (morse code): Funny that this reminds of Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon (one of the richest people in the world), have you heard that Amazon workers can&#39;t even go to bathroom often? Ms. Park says that you will be rich if you live in the house with ghosts (hard working class, the poor). The poor are like ghosts here. The rich don&#39;t want to believe the poor exist or don&#39;t want to see them, but the rich need the poor to support their luxury life style. The guy in the basement blindly respects Mr. Park even though Mr. Park doesn&#39;t even know the guy exists. <br><br><br>Anyway, this is just what I think after watching the movie. Again, thanks for your movie reviews.",enjoy movie reviews sometimes decide watch movies made watch movie thank watching movie theater able stop thinking movie day sure whether gon post parasite extended spoiler review want share felt movie originally south korea got used korean cultures understanding movie could different many things talk believe water stone scholar rock ghosts important symbols water taken shower cold water try minute cold shower warm amp hot water initiates fight flight response makes discomfort drunk guy beginning movie got cold water wake think water reveals water naturally flows gravity inevitably kim family day dream rich park house ended rain confront brutal reality park family reveal disgust poor raining stone scholar rock think stone means superficial wealth luxuries like gucci bag real use stone object show gucci bag useful practical person makes per month probably daily life media constantly tell buy items look like rich person media owned rich people tell poor people worthless rich people respected movie stone shows flooding like quot quot primitive desire emerges quot superego quot conscience reality water son movie hide desire rich deep inside clings stone thinks poor worthless even though one poor ghosts morse code funny reminds jeff bezos ceo amazon one richest people world heard amazon workers even bathroom often park says rich live house ghosts hard working class poor poor like ghosts rich want believe poor exist want see rich need poor support luxury life style guy basement blindly respects park even though park even know guy exists anyway think watching movie thanks movie reviews,positive

I know she wouldn&#39;t think about it in the moment because of panic, but afterwards she would have told the police about it if she did notice.

"The meaning of parasite(Both the rich and the poor are parasites!!)<br>  - There are two meanings<br>1) infiltrate : the poor(Gitak&#39;s family and the basement family) infiltrate their money and place. And also the rich(Park&#39;s family) also infiltrate the poor and suck up their labors.<br>2) aversion(abhorrence): We generally abhor the parasite. If the rich and the poor don&#39;t respect each other, there are possibility for them to abhor each other because of various reasons. The limitation of Capitalism is that the gap between the rich and the poor is widening. The poor&#39;s deprivation and the rich&#39;s ignorance toward the poor can come into &quot;conflict&quot;. <br>It means that the rich regard the poor as parasites and vice versa. <br>These days, One&#39;s effort can not lessen the gap between the rich and the poor.

The richer may dislike the poor but at the end, when the poors actually is the one that wanted to kill the poor, and then the other poor instead of taking his revenge on the poor, instead he turned to the rich. And then probably the best human being died but the most evil one survived but remain being tortured.

"I&#39;ve known NOTHING about this, other than &quot;It&#39;s Horror&quot; and &quot;It&#39;s Asian&quot;, and that alone, is good enough for one of my friends, who is REALLY into this stuff, and says that, if you only watch 80&#39;s slasher flicks, you&#39;re not ready for something like, say, Martyrs (sp?). I&#39;ve heard <b>of</b> Martyrs, from this friend, and I get that Japanese horror flicks are not for the casual western viewer, who only knows Freddy, Jason, Pennywise, the Xenomorph, the Terminator, the Predator, etc. It&#39;s a big leap from the 80&#39;s action/horror cliches, to the whole world of Japanese horror, especially the less commercial stuff. And I totally get the fear of jumping from &quot;Generic 80&#39;s blockbuster horror&quot; to &quot;Japanese stuff you definitely haven&#39;t heard of before, trust me, it&#39;s sick&quot; (and that Joss Whedon had some stuff from The Ring and some of that Eastern Horror featured in Cabin In The Woods, as just a taste of what &quot;Eastern Horror&quot; has in store&quot;. I haven&#39;t really seen anything in that Eastern Horror section.  But.

I just kept seeing so much praised heaped on it so I had some free time and went to the cinema down the street. I was totally expecting a serious drama about a lower class family and their struggles. I was not expecting such a lighthearted, smart, and funny film. The pacing of the film zips by for the first half. There‚Äôs so much to love about how the story plays out that when the reveal happens that introduces the next story arc, I was completely surprised by it. <br><br>It still managed to be funny, but with darker undertones, and it gradually became a tragedy only to shift into another stylistic tone. And it executed it so well without it seeming forced or gimmicky. I think this merging of tones is a welcomed surprise for western audiences who may normally think of foreign films as high brow, intellectually stimulating but otherwise boring movies. This felt modern, quick, smart, clever, and it pulls off something very tricky‚Äînot taking itself so seriously but also not being frivolous and empty. I think it truly rewards the viewer and shows how filmmakers can tell engaging, sharp stories in new ways that still feel somewhat grounded in the familiar. Very enjoyable film.
